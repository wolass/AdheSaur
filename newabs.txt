Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease with increasing prevalence, is closely associated with skin barrier defects. A cytokine related to disease severity and inhibition of keratinocyte differentiation is IL-31. To identify its molecular targets, IL-31-dependent gene expression was determined in three-dimensional organotypic skin models. IL-31-regulated genes are involved in  the formation of an intact physical skin barrier. Many of these genes were poorly induced during differentiation as a consequence of IL-31 treatment, resulting in  increased penetrability to allergens and irritants. Furthermore, studies employing cell-sorted skin equivalents in SCID/NOD mice demonstrated enhanced transepidermal water loss following s.c. administration of IL-31. We identified the IL-1 cytokine network as a downstream effector of IL-31 signaling. Anakinra,  an IL-1R antagonist, blocked the IL-31 effects on skin differentiation. In addition to the effects on the physical barrier, IL-31 stimulated the expression  of antimicrobial peptides, thereby inhibiting bacterial growth on the three-dimensional organotypic skin models. This was evident already at low doses  of IL-31, insufficient to interfere with the physical barrier. Together, these findings demonstrate that IL-31 affects keratinocyte differentiation in multiple  ways and that the IL-1 cytokine network is a major downstream effector of IL-31 signaling in deregulating the physical skin barrier. Moreover, by interfering with IL-31, a currently evaluated drug target, we will have to consider that low  doses of IL-31 promote the antimicrobial barrier, and thus a complete inhibition  of IL-31 signaling may be undesirable.

The mechanistic relationship between IL-4/IL-13 and skin barrier function has been of interest since the filaggrin discovery and the subsequent in vitro demonstration that IL-4 and IL-13 downregulate filaggrin expression in cultured keratinocytes. Hönzke and colleagues explore these interactions further. The effects of IL-4/ll-13 may be context dependent, with differing roles in homeostasis and in disease.  Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

Wölfle U(1), Haarhaus B(1), Schempp CM(1).  Author information:  (1)Research Center skinitial, Department of Dermatology, University Medical Center, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.  Keratinocytes express the bitter taste receptors TAS2R1 and TAS2R38. Amarogentin  as an agonist for TAS2R1 and other TAS2Rs promotes keratinocyte differentiation.  Similarly, mast cells are known to express bitter taste receptors. The aim of this study was to assess whether bitter compounds display immunomodulatory effects on these immunocompetent cells in the skin, so that they might be a target in chronic inflammatory diseases such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.  Here, we investigated the impact of amarogentin on substance P-induced release of histamine and TNF-α from the human mast cell line LAD-2. Furthermore, the effect  of amarogentin on HaCaT keratinocytes costimulated with TNF-α and histamine was investigated. Amarogentin inhibited in LAD-2 cells substance P-induced production of newly synthesized TNF-α, but the degranulation and release of stored histamine were not affected. In HaCaT keratinocytes histamine and TNF-α induced IL-8 and MMP-1 expression was reduced by amarogentin to a similar extent as with azelastine. In conclusion amarogentin displays immunomodulatory effects in the skin by interacting with mast cells and keratinocytes.  DOI: 10.1155/2015/630128  PMCID: PMC4639662	26600671

Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are important in effector functions for eliciting allergic inflammation, parasite defense, epithelial repair, and lipid homeostasis. ILC2 lack rearranged Ag-specific receptors, and although many soluble factors such as cytokines and lipid mediators can influence ILC2, direct  interaction of these cells with the microenvironment and other cells has been less explored. Natural cytotoxicity receptors are expressed by subsets of group 1 ILC and group 3 ILC and thought to be important for their effector function, but  they have not been shown to be expressed by ILC2. Therefore, we sought to investigate the expression and functional properties of the natural cytotoxicity  receptor NKp30 on human ILC2. A subset of ex vivo and cultured ILC2 express NKp30 that upon interaction with its cognate activatory ligand B7-H6 induces rapid production of type 2 cytokines. This interaction can be blocked by NKp30 blocking Ab and an inhibitory ligand, galectin-3. Higher expression of B7-H6 was observed  in lesional skin biopsies of patients with atopic dermatitis, and incubation of keratinocytes with proinflammatory and type 2 cytokines upregulated B7-H6, leading to increased ILC2 cytokine production. NKp30-B7-H6 interaction is a novel cell contact mechanism that mediates activation of ILC2 and identifies a potential target for the development of novel therapeutics for atopic dermatitis  and other atopic diseases.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis represent a complex interaction between the skin and infiltrating immune cells, resulting in damage to the skin barrier and increased inflammation. Polymorphisms in PHF11 have been associated with dermatitis and allergy and PHF11 regulates the transcription of T-cell cytokines as well as class switching to IgE in activated  B-cells. The importance of skin barrier homeostasis in the context of inflammatory skin diseases, together with reports identifying PHF11 as an interferon-induced gene, have led us to examine its role in the innate immune response of keratinocytes. RESULTS: We developed a cell culture model that allowed us to analyze the effects of the double-stranded RNA analogue poly(I:C) on a confluent cell monolayer immediately after a 24-h treatment, as well as three days after withdrawal of treatment. Immediately after treatment with poly(I:C), PHF11, IL8, and interferon-dependent ISG15 RNA expression was increased. This was accompanied by  nuclear localization of PHF11 as well the tight junction protein claudin-1. Knock-down of PHF11 resulted in increased interleukin-8 expression and secretion  immediately following treatment with poly(I:C), as well as changes in the cellular distribution of membrane-bound and increased nuclear claudin-1 that was  observed up to 3 days after the withdrawal of poly(I:C). This was associated with lower cell density and a decrease in the number of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to a role for PHF11 in lymphocyte gene expression, we have now shown that PHF11 was part of the keratinocyte innate immune response by  poly(I:C). As knock-down of PHF11 was associated with increased expression of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IL-8 and changes in the cellular distribution of claudin-1, a change normally associated with increased proliferation and migration, we suggest that PHF11 may contribute to epidermal recovery following infection or other damage.

The mechanisms by which the epidermis responds to disturbances in barrier function and restores homeostasis are unknown. With a perturbation of the epidermal barrier, water is lost, resulting in an increase in extracellular sodium concentration. We demonstrate that the sodium channel Nax functions as a sodium sensor. With increased extracellular sodium, Nax up-regulates prostasin, which results in activation of the sodium channel ENaC, resulting in increased sodium flux and increased downstream mRNA synthesis of inflammatory mediators. Nax is present in multiple epithelial tissues, and up-regulation of its downstream genes is found in hypertrophic scars. In animal models, blocking Nax expression results in improvement in scarring and atopic dermatitis-like symptoms, both of which are pathological conditions characterized by perturbations in barrier function. These findings support an important role for Nax in maintaining epithelial homeostasis.  Copyright © 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines play a crucial role in the etiology of atopic dermatitis. We demonstrated that Herba Epimedii has anti-inflammatory potential in an atopic dermatitis mouse model; however, limited research has been conducted on the anti-inflammatory effects and mechanism of icariin, the major active ingredient in Herba Epimedii, in human keratinocytes. In this study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory potential and mechanisms of icariin in the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)/interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-induced inflammatory response in human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) by observing these cells in the presence or absence of icariin. We measured IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, MCP-1 and GRO-α production by ELISA; IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and tachykinin receptor 1 (TACR1) mRNA expression by real-time PCR; and P38-MAPK, P-ERK and P-JNK signaling expression by western blot in TNF-α/IFN-γ-stimulated HaCaT cells  before and after icariin treatment. The expression of TNF-α-R1 and IFN-γ-R1 during the stimulation of the cell models was also evaluated before and after icariin treatment. We investigated the effect of icariin on these pro-inflammatory cytokines and detected whether this effect occurred via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathways. We further  specifically inhibited the activity of two kinases with 20μM SB203580 (a p38 kinase inhibitor) and 50μM PD98059 (an ERK1/2 kinase inhibitor) to determine the  roles of the two signal pathways involved in the inflammatory response. We found  that icariin inhibited TNF-α/IFN-γ-induced IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and MCP-1 production in a dose-dependent manner; meanwhile, the icariin treatment inhibited the gene expression of IL-8, IL-1β, ICAM-1 and TACR1 in HaCaT cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Icariin treatment resulted in a reduced expression of  p-P38 and p-ERK signal activation induced by TNF-α/IFN-γ; however, only SB203580, the p38 alpha/beta inhibitor, inhibited the secretion of inflammatory cytokines induced by TNF-α/IFN-γ in cultured HaCaT cells. The differential expression of TNF-α-R1 and IFN-γ-R1 was also observed after the stimulation of TNF-α/IFN-γ, which was significantly normalized after the icariin treatment. Collectively, we  illustrated the anti-inflammatory property of icariin in human keratinocytes. These effects were mediated, at least partially, via the inhibition of substance  P and the p38-MAPK signaling pathway, as well as by the regulation of the TNF-α-R1 and IFN-γ-R1 signals.

The tight junction protein claudin 1 (Cldn-1) has been reported to be down-regulated in nonlesional  skin of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients. In contrast, we did not observe a significant down-regulation of Cldn-1 in nonlesional skin of the AD cohort used in this study. However, for the first time, a significant down-regulation of Cldn-1 in the upper and lower epidermal layers of lesional skin was detected. In  addition, there was a significant up-regulation of Cldn-4 in nonlesional, but not lesional, AD skin. For occludin, no significant alterations were observed. In an  AD-like allergic dermatitis mouse model, Cldn-1 down-regulation in eczema was significantly influenced by dermal inflammation, and significantly correlated with hallmarks of eczema (ie, increased keratinocyte proliferation, altered keratinocyte differentiation, increased epidermal thickness, and impaired barrier function). In human epidermal equivalents, the addition of IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31 resulted in a down-regulation of Cldn-1, and Cldn1 knockdown in keratinocytes resulted in abnormal differentiation. In summary, we provide the first evidence that Cldn-1 and Cldn-4 are differentially involved in AD pathogenesis. Our data suggest a role of Cldn-1 in AD eczema formation triggered by inflammation.

Accumulation and activation of epidermal γδ T cells in a mouse model of chronic dermatitis is not required for the inflammatory phenotype.  Sulcova J(1), Maddaluno L(1), Meyer M(1), Werner S(1).  Author information:  (1)Department of Biology, Institute of Molecular Health Sciences, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.  Chronic skin inflammation resulting from a defective epidermal barrier is a hallmark of atopic dermatitis (AD). We previously demonstrated that mice lacking  FGF receptors 1 and 2 in keratinocytes (K5-R1/R2 mice) develop an AD-like chronic dermatitis as a result of an impaired epidermal barrier. Here, we show that γδ T  cells, which rapidly respond to various insults, accumulate in the epidermis of K5-R1/R2 mice before the development of histological abnormalities. Their number  and activation further increase as the phenotype progresses, most likely as a consequence of increased expression of Il-2 and Il-7 and the stress-induced proteins Rae-1, H60c, Mult1, PlexinB2, and Skint1. To determine the role of γδ T  cells in the skin phenotype, we generated quadruple mutant K5-R1/-R2 mice lacking γδ T cells. Surprisingly, loss of γδ T cells did not or only marginally affect keratinocyte proliferation, epidermal thickness, epidermal barrier function, and  accumulation and activation of different immune cells in the skin of K5-R1/R2 mice, possibly due to partial compensation by αβ T cells. These results demonstrate that γδ T cells do not contribute to the development or maintenance of chronic inflammation in response to a defect in the epidermal barrier.  © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AKT1-mediated Lamin A/C degradation is required for nuclear degradation and normal epidermal terminal differentiation.

Nuclear degradation is a key stage in keratinocyte terminal differentiation and the formation of the cornified envelope that comprises the majority of epidermal  barrier function. Parakeratosis, the retention of nuclear material in the cornified layer of the epidermis, is a common histological observation in many skin diseases, notably in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Keratinocyte nuclear degradation is not well characterised, and it is unclear whether the retained nuclei contribute to the altered epidermal differentiation seen in eczema and psoriasis. Loss of AKT1 function strongly correlated with parakeratosis both in eczema samples and in organotypic culture models. Although levels of DNAses, including DNase1L2, were unchanged, proteomic analysis revealed an increase in Lamin A/C. AKT phosphorylates Lamin A/C, targeting it for degradation. Consistent with this, Lamin A/C degradation was inhibited and Lamin A/C was observed in the  cornified layer of AKT1 knockdown organotypic cultures, surrounding retained nuclear material. Using AKT-phosphorylation-dead Lamin A constructs we show that  the retention of nuclear material is sufficient to cause profound changes in epidermal terminal differentiation, specifically a reduction in Loricrin, Keratin 1, Keratin 10, and filaggrin expression. We show that preventing nuclear degradation upregulates BMP2 expression and SMAD1 signalling. Consistent with these data, we observe both parakeratosis and evidence of increased SMAD1 signalling in atopic dermatitis. We therefore present a model that, in the absence of AKT1-mediated Lamin A/C degradation, DNA degradation processes, such as those mediated by DNAse 1L2, are prevented, leading to parakeratosis and changes in epidermal differentiation.

Aktar MK(1), Kido-Nakahara M(1), Furue M(1,)(2), Nakahara T(2).  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan. (2)Division of Skin Surface Sensing, Department of Dermatology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.  BACKGROUND: Endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been reported to evoke histamine-independent  pruritus in mammals. However, its association with pruritus or inflammation of atopic dermatitis (AD) has not been clarified. We sought to investigate the role  of ET-1 in the skin inflammation of AD. METHODS: To examine the role of ET-1 in AD, we investigated the expression of ET-1 and IL-25 in the skin of an AD mouse model and patients with AD and examined the mutual regulatory relationship between ET-1 and IL-25, one of the important cytokines in AD, using the human HaCaT keratinocyte cell line. RESULTS: We immunohistochemically confirmed the upregulation of ET-1 and IL-25 expression in the epidermis of both the AD mouse model and patients with AD. In vitro, IL-25 upregulated ET-1 mRNA and protein expression in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion in HaCaT cells. This IL-25-induced ET-1 expression was inhibited by ERK1/2 or JNK inhibitor. In a reciprocal manner, ET-1 also induced IL-25 upregulation. The enhancing effect of ET-1 on IL-25 was inhibited by an endothelin A receptor antagonist, ERK1/2 inhibitor, or p38 inhibitor, but not by  an endothelin B receptor antagonist or JNK inhibitor. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that mutual upregulation of ET-1 and IL-25 takes place in the epidermis of AD, which may be a future target for antipruritic agents.  © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Anatomy and Cell Biology/Temple Itch Center, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, 19140, USA.  Protease-activated receptors (PARs) have been implicated in a variety of physiological functions, as well as somatosensation and particularly itch and pain. Considerable attention has focused on PARs following the finding they are upregulated in the skin of atopic dermatitis patients. The present review focuses on recent studies showing that PARs are critically involved in itch and sensitization of itch. PARs are expressed by diverse cell types including primary sensory neurons, keratinocytes, and immune cells and are activated by proteases that expose a tethered ligand. Endogenous proteases are also released from diverse cell types including keratinocytes and immune cells. Exogenous proteases  released from certain plants and insects contacting the skin can also induce itch. Increased levels of proteases in the skin contribute to inflammation that is often accompanied by chronic itch which is not predominantly mediated by histamine. The neural pathway signaling itch induced by activation of PARs is distinct from that mediating histamine-induced itch. In addition, there is evidence that PARs play an important role in sensitization of itch signaling under conditions of chronic itch. These recent findings suggest that PARs and other molecules involved in the itch-signaling pathway are good targets to develop novel treatments for most types of chronic itch that are poorly treated with antihistamines.

Chronic inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, affect a large percentage of the population, but the role of different immune cells in the pathogenesis of these disorders is largely unknown. Recently, we found that mice  lacking fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (Fgfr1) and Fgfr2 (K5-R1/R2 mice) in  the epidermis have a severe impairment in the epidermal barrier, which leads to the development of a chronic inflammatory skin disease that shares many features  with human atopic dermatitis. Using Fgfr1-/Fgfr2-deficient mice, we analyzed the  consequences of the loss of mast cells. Mast cells accumulated and degranulated in the skin of young Fgfr1-/Fgfr2-deficient mice, most likely as a consequence of increased expression of the mast cell chemokine Ccl2. The increase in mast cells  occurred before the development of histological abnormalities, indicating a functional role of these cells in the inflammatory skin phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we mated the Fgfr1-/Fgfr2-deficient mice with mast cell-deficient CreMaster mice. Surprisingly, loss of mast cells did not or only mildly affect keratinocyte proliferation, epidermal thickness, epidermal barrier function, accumulation and activation of different immune cells, or expression of different proinflammatory cytokines in the skin. These results reveal that mast cells are dispensable for the development of chronic inflammation in response to a defect in the epidermal barrier.

Its role in atopic dermatitis (AD) was examined in just a few studies, including nucleotide polymorphisms, increased transcriptional levels of IL-9 and  IL-9R in diseased skin, and an association of blood IL-9 levels with clinical severity. OBJECTIVE: Little was known about the pathophysiological regulation of IL-9/IL-9R in AD skin. We asked whether IL-9R was expressed in epidermal keratinocytes; if so, what the functional outcome, cytokine production, and signaling pathway of IL-9/IL-9R in keratinocytes are. METHODS: We measured and compared the expression of IL-9R in skin from AD patients and controls by immunofluorescence. We also performed in vitro studies on the IL-9-treated primary keratinocytes, including flow cytometry for IL-9R expressions, Western blotting for mTOR, S6K, ERK, p38, and STAT3 activations, ELISA for cytokine levels, and immunofluorescence for STIM1. RESULTS: We found that IL-9R was indeed expressed in keratinocytes but not in fibroblasts. Its expression in keratinocytes was enhanced by IL-4 but not by TGF-beta1. IL-9 induced a moderate production of IL-8 but not CXCL16, CCL22, TSLP, nor IL-33. IL-9 induced formation of STIM1-puncta. IL-9 induced ERK phosphorylation both dose- and time-dependently, but not mTOR, S6K, p38, or STAT3. Pretreatment with U0126 (ERK inhibitor) but not rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor) abrogated the IL-9-mediated IL-8 production. Blockage of STIM1 with BTP2 or SKF96265 abrogated ERK phosphorylation and IL-8 production induced by IL-9. CONCLUSION: This study represents the first to show the regulation of the IL-9-STIM1-ERK-IL-8 axis in keratinocyte, and how the axis might play an important role in the pathophysiology of AD.

BACKGROUND: Nerve growth factor (NGF), a neurotrophin that plays a critical role  in developmental neurobiology, is released by proliferating keratinocytes and induces proliferation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of tyrosine kinase receptor A (TrkA), a high-affinity receptor of NGF, in human keratinocytes. METHODS: Expression of TrkA and NGF in skin diseases was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Expression of TrkA in cells was examined by Western blotting and RT-PCR. Cell proliferation was assessed by BrdU assay. RESULTS: We first determined the expression of TrkA and NGF in skin samples from  patients with atopic dermatitis, prurigo nodularis, psoriasis vulgaris, and seborrheic keratosis. TrkA was only expressed in proliferating basal cells, and its expression was enhanced in atopic dermatitis samples. NGF expression was enhanced in atopic dermatitis and prurigo nodularis samples and in some samples from seborrheic keratosis patients. Investigation of the role of TrkA in vitro using normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) revealed that TrkA was significantly enhanced by the T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines interleukin (IL)-4  and IL-13 but not by other inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, tumor necrosis  factor α, interferon γ, or epidermal growth factor. On the other hand, expression of NGF was not altered by Th2 cytokines. Notably, inhibition of TrkA significantly reversed the effects of IL-4 on proliferation and differentiation.  Furthermore, overexpression of TrkA enhanced proliferation of NHEK. These results indicate that IL-4-induced TrkA expression in keratinocytes modulates proliferation and differentiation of these cells. CONCLUSION: Increased TrkA expression in keratinocytes in atopic dermatitis may contribute to the observed epidermal hyperproliferation in these patients.

Author information:  (1)Division of Immune Regulation, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology,  La Jolla, California, USA.

Several inflammatory diseases including scleroderma and atopic dermatitis display dermal thickening, epidermal hypertrophy, or excessive accumulation of collagen.  Factors that might promote these features are of interest for clinical therapy. We previously reported that LIGHT, a TNF superfamily molecule, mediated collagen  deposition in the lungs in response to allergen. We therefore tested whether LIGHT might similarly promote collagen accumulation and features of skin fibrosis. Strikingly, injection of recombinant soluble LIGHT into naive mice, either subcutaneously or systemically, promoted collagen deposition in the skin and dermal and epidermal thickening. This replicated the activity of bleomycin, an antibiotic that has been previously used in models of scleroderma in mice. Moreover skin fibrosis induced by bleomycin was dependent on endogenous LIGHT activity. The action of LIGHT in vivo was mediated via both of its receptors, HVEM and LTβR, and was dependent on the innate cytokine TSLP and TGF-β. Furthermore, we found that HVEM and LTβR were expressed on human epidermal keratinocytes and that LIGHT could directly promote TSLP expression in these cells. We reveal an unappreciated activity of LIGHT on keratinocytes and suggest  that LIGHT may be an important mediator of skin inflammation and fibrosis in diseases such as scleroderma or atopic dermatitis.

Recent evidence reveals a crucial role for acetylcholine and its receptors in the regulation of inflammation, particularly of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α7 (Chrna7) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 3 (Chrm3). Immunohistochemistry is a key tool for their cellular localization in functional tissues. We evaluated nine different commercially available antibodies on back skin tissue from wild-type (Wt) and gene-deficient (KO) mice. In the immunohistochemical analysis, we focused on key AChR-ligand sensitive skin cells (mast cells, nerve fibers and  keratinocytes). All five antibodies tested for Chrm3 and the first three Chrna7 antibodies stained positive in both Wt and respective KO skin. With the 4th antibody (ab23832) nerve fibers were unlabeled in the KO mice. By western blot analysis, this antibody detected bands in both Wt and Chrna7 KO skin and brain. qRT-PCR revealed mRNA amplification with a primer set for the undeleted region in both Wt and KO mice, but none with a primer set for the deleted region in KO mice. By 2D electrophoresis, we found β-actin and β-enolase cross reactivity, which was confirmed by double immunolabeling. In view of the present results, the tested antibodies are not suitable for immunolocalization in skin and suggest thorough control of antibody specificity is required if histomorphometry is intended.  © The Author(s) 2015.

Santoro D(1), Ahrens K, Marsella R, Segre M.  Author information:  (1)Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA; Department of Dermatology, College of Medicine, University  of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.  Increased secretion of antimicrobial peptides and cytokines is present in atopic  skin. The purpose of this study was to compare the production of β-defensin (cBD)3-like, cathelicidin (cCath) and cytokines in atopic and healthy canine keratinocytes. Seven atopic house dust mites (HDMs) sensitive and five healthy age-matched beagles were used. Keratinocytes were stimulated for 24 h, and the supernatant was collected. A significantly higher production of cBD3-like was present at baseline in atopic compared with healthy keratinocytes, but cBD3-like  did not increase after stimulation. IL-17 and lipopolysaccharide increased cBD3-like in healthy compared with atopic keratinocytes. cCath increased in both  groups after stimulation. Atopic keratinocytes exposed to HDM produced more IL-8  and keratinocyte-derived chemokine-like than healthy keratinocytes. Exposure to HDM induced an increased IL-8 in atopic keratinocytes and a decreased IFN-γ in healthy keratinocytes. These results may suggest an over sensitization of atopic  keratinocytes and a possible impairment of the cutaneous defense against micro-organisms.  © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Author information:  (1)Department of Biomedical Science and Research Institute for Bioscience & Biotechnology, Hallym University, Chuncheon 24252, Korea.  Up-regulation of cell adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines contributes to enhanced monocyte adhesiveness and infiltration into the skin, during the pathogenesis of various inflammatory skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis. In this study, we examined the anti-inflammatory effects of butein, a tetrahydroxychalcone, and its action mechanisms using TNF-α-stimulated keratinocytes. Butein significantly inhibited TNF-α-induced ICAM-I expression and monocyte adhesion in human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. Butein also decreased TNF-α-induced pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6, IP-10 and MCP-1, in HaCaT cells. Butein decreased TNF-α-induced ROS generation in a dose-dependent manner in HaCaT cells. In addition, treatment of HaCaT cells with butein suppressed TNF-α-induced MAPK activation. Furthermore, butein suppressed TNF-α-induced NF-kappaB activation. Overall, our results indicate that butein has immunomodulatory activities by inhibiting expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in keratinocytes. Therefore, butein may be used as a therapeutic agent  for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases.   PMCID: PMC4641232	25541056

Regular keratinocyte differentiation is crucial for the formation of an intact epidermal barrier and is triggered by extracellular calcium. Disturbances of epidermal barrier formation and aberrant keratinocyte differentiation are involved in the pathophysiology of several skin diseases, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, basal and squamous skin cancer, and genetic skin diseases such as Darier's disease and Olmstedt syndrome. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about the underlying molecular mechanisms of calcium-induced differentiation in keratinocytes. We provide an overview of calcium's genomic and non-genomic mechanisms to induce differentiation and discuss the calcium gradient in the epidermis, giving rise to cornified skin and lipid envelope formation. We  focus on the calcium-sensing receptor, transient receptor potential channels, and STIM/Orai as the major constituents of calcium sensing and calcium entry in the keratinocytes. Finally, skin diseases linked to impaired differentiation will be  discussed, paying special attention to disturbed TRP channel expression and TRP channel mutations.

Through bioinformatics analyses of a comprehensive database of gene expression (BIGE: Body Index of Gene Expression) we observed that a small secreted protein encoded by a poorly characterized gene called meteorin-like (METRNL), is highly expressed in mucosal  tissues, skin and activated macrophages. Further studies indicate that Metrnl is  produced by Alternatively Activated Macrophages (AAM) and M-CSF cultured bone marrow macrophages (M2-like macrophages). In the skin, METRNL is expressed by resting fibroblasts and IFNγ-treated keratinocytes. A screen of human skin-associated diseases showed significant over-expression of METRNL in psoriasis, prurigo nodularis, actinic keratosis and atopic dermatitis. METRNL is  also up-regulated in synovial membranes of human rheumatoid arthritis. Taken together, these results indicate that Metrnl represents a novel cytokine, which is likely involved in both innate and acquired immune responses.  Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

BACKGROUND: Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), which catalyses the conversion of cyclic  adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) to 5'-AMP, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders. Pruritus is the main symptom of dermatitides, such as atopic dermatitis, and is very difficult to control. Recent studies have shown that the activation of proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR2)  is involved in pruritus in dermatoses in humans and rodents. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the inhibitory effect of E6005, a topically effective PDE4 inhibitor, on PAR2-associated itching in mice. METHODS: Mice were given an intradermal injection of SLIGRL-NH2 (100 nmol/site),  a PAR2 agonist peptide, into the rostral part of the back. E6005 and 8-bromo-cAMP were applied topically and injected intradermally, respectively, to the same site. Scratching bouts were observed as an itch-related behavior, and firing activity of the cutaneous nerve was electrophysiologically recorded. Keratinocytes were isolated from the skin of neonatal mice and cultured for in vitro experiments. The concentrations of cAMP and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) were measured by enzyme immunoassay. The distribution of PDE4 subtypes in the skin was investigated by immunostaining. RESULTS: Topical E6005 and intradermal 8-bromo-cAMP significantly inhibited SLIGRL-NH2-induced scratching and cutaneous nerve firing. Topical E6005 increased cutaneous cAMP content. Topical E6005 and intradermal 8-bromo-cAMP inhibited cutaneous LTB4 production induced by SLIGRL-NH2, which has been shown to elicit LTB4-mediated scratching. E6005 and 8-bromo-cAMP inhibited SLIGRL-NH2-induced LTB4 production in the cultured murine keratinocytes also. PDE4 subtypes were mainly expressed in keratinocytes and mast cells in the skin. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that topical E6005 treatment inhibits PAR2-associated itching. Inhibition of LTB4 production mediated by an increase in cAMP may be partly involved in the antipruritic action of E6005.  Copyright © 2014 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

In the epidermis, tight junction (TJ) structure is specifically located in the stratum granulosum, where the expression of ΔNp63, a p53 family transcription factor, is attenuated. Since the relationship between ΔNp63 and barrier function  has not been fully uncovered, we assessed expression profiles of TJ proteins in skin tissues and cultured keratinocytes. The results showed that expression of ΔNp63 and that of claudin-4 were inversely correlated in healthy human epidermis. In vitro studies using HaCaT keratinocytes revealed functional relevance of ΔNp63 and claudin-4. Curiously, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 ligand, which is known to be liberated from damaged cells, suppressed ΔNp63 expression and concomitantly upregulated claudin-4 expression in primary keratinocytes. More interestingly, a  broad expression pattern of claudin-4 was found in the epidermis of atopic dermatitis (AD), a barrier defect disorder, which contains ΔNp63-lacking keratinocytes as we reported previously.

Glutamate plays an important role in skin barrier signaling. In our previous study, Yokukansan (YKS) affected glutamate receptors in NC/Nga mice and was ameliorated in atopic dermatitis lesions. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of YKS on skin and cultured human keratinocytes. Glutamate concentrations  in skin of YKS-treated and nontreated NC/Nga mice were measured. Then, glutamate  release from cultured keratinocytes was measured, and extracellular glutamate concentrations in YKS-stimulated cultured human keratinocytes were determined. The mRNA expression levels of NMDA receptor 2D (NMDAR2D) and glutamate aspartate  transporter (GLAST) were also determined in YKS-stimulated cultured keratinocytes. The glutamate concentrations and dermatitis scores increased in conventional mice, whereas they decreased in YKS-treated mice. Glutamate concentrations in cell supernatants of cultured keratinocytes increased proportionally to the cell density. However, they decreased dose-dependently with YKS. YKS stimulation increased NMDAR2D in a concentration-dependent manner. Conversely, GLAST decreased in response to YKS. Our findings indicate that YKS affects peripheral glutamate signaling in keratinocytes. Glutamine is essential as a transmitter, and dermatitis lesions might produce and release excess glutamate. This study suggests that, in keratinocytes, YKS controls extracellular glutamate concentrations, suppresses N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and activates glutamate transport.

Several dermatoses, including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and rosacea, alter the expression of the innate immune effector human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP). To elucidate the roles of aberrant CAMP in dermatoses, we performed cDNA array analysis in CAMP-stimulated human epidermal keratinocytes, the primary cells responding to innate immune stimuli and a major source of CAMP  LL37 in skin. Among LL37-inducible genes, IL-1 cluster genes, particularly IL36G, are of interest because we observed coordinate increases in CAMP and IL-36γ in the lesional skin of psoriasis, whereas virtually no CAMP or IL-36γ was observed  in nonlesional skin and normal skin. The production and release of IL-36γ were up to 20-30 ng/ml in differentiated keratinocytes cultured in high-calcium media. G-protein inhibitor pertussis toxin and p38 inhibitor suppressed IL-36γ induction by LL37. As an alarmin, LL37 induces chemokines, including CXCL1, CXCL8/IL8, CXCL10/IP-10, and CCL20/MIP3a, and IL-36 (10-100 ng/ml) augments the production of these chemokines by LL37. Pretreatment with small interfering RNA against IL36γ and IL-36R IL36R/IL1RL2 and IL1RAP suppressed LL37-dependent IL8, CXCL1, CXCL10/IP10, and CCL20 production in keratinocytes, suggesting that the alarmin function of LL37 was partially dependent on IL-36γ and its receptors. Counting on CAMP induction in innate stimuli, such as in infection and wounding, IL-36γ induction by cathelicidin would explain the mechanism of initiation of skin inflammation and occasional exacerbations of psoriasis and skin diseases by general infection.

The human epidermis provides a very effective barrier function against chemical,  physical and microbial insults from the environment. This is only possible as the epidermis renews itself constantly. Stem cells located at the basal lamina which  forms the dermoepidermal junction provide an almost inexhaustible source of keratinocytes which differentiate and die during their journey to the surface where they are shed off as scales. Despite the continuous renewal of the epidermis it nevertheless succumbs to aging as the turnover rate of the keratinocytes is slowing down dramatically. Aging is associated with such hallmarks as thinning of the epidermis, elastosis, loss of melanocytes associated with an increased paleness and lucency of the skin and a decreased barrier function. As the differentiation of keratinocytes is strictly calcium dependent,  calcium also plays an important role in the aging epidermis. Just recently it was shown that the epidermal calcium gradient in the skin that facilitates the proliferation of keratinocytes in the stratum basale and enables differentiation  in the stratum granulosum is lost in the process of skin aging. In the course of  this review we try to explain how this calcium gradient is built up on the one hand and is lost during aging on the other hand. How this disturbed calcium homeostasis is affecting the gene expression in aged skin and is leading to dramatic changes in the composition of the cornified envelope will also be discussed. This loss of the epidermal calcium gradient is not only specific for skin aging but can also be found in skin diseases such as Darier disease, Hailey-Hailey disease, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, which might be very helpful to get a deeper insight in skin aging.

Ohsawa Y(1), Hirasawa N(1).  Author information:  (1)Laboratory of Pharmacotherapy of Life-Style Related Diseases, Graduate School  of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, Miyagi, Japan.  Histamine plays important roles in inflammation and nervous irritability in allergic disorders, including atopic dermatitis (AD). It has been shown to regulate the expression of pruritic factors, such as nerve growth factor and semaphorin 3A, in skin keratinocytes via histamine H1 receptor (H1R). Furthermore, H1R antagonist reduced the level of IL-31, a cytokine involving the  skin barrier and pruritus, in chronic dermatitis lesions in NC/Nga mice and patients with AD. Histamine plays roles in the induction of allergic inflammation by activating eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, and Th2 cells via histamine H4  receptor (H4R). H4R, in addition to H1R, is expressed on sensory neurons, and a decrease in scratching behaviors was observed in H4R-deficient mice and mice treated with a H4R antagonist. We found that the combined administration of H1R and H4R antagonists inhibited the itch response and chronic allergic inflammation, and had a pharmacological effect similar to that of prednisolone. Although the oral administration of H1R antagonists is widely used to treat AD, it is not very effective. In contrast, JNJ39758979, a novel H4R antagonist, had marked effects against pruritus in Japanese patients with AD in a phase II clinical trial. Next generation antihistaminic agents possessing H1R and H4R antagonistic actions may be a potent therapeutic drug for AD.  DOI: 10.2332/allergolint.13-RA-0675 	25249063

Skin protects body from continual attack by microbial pathogens and environmental factors. Such barrier function of skin is achieved by multiple components including immune system, which is mainly regulated by lymphocytes. T lymphocytes  (T cells) that express T cell receptor (TCR) α and β chains (αβT cells) control the strength and the type of immune response. CD4T cell population consists of helper T (Th) cell-subsets and immunosuppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells. Th1 cells produce IFN-γ and protect against intracellular pathogens. Th2 cells produce IL-4 family cytokines and participate in allergic skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD). Th17 cells secrete IL-17, recruit granulocytes  to fight against extracellular microorganisms, and play a role in psoriasis and AD. Th22 cells produce IL-22 that activates epithelial cells and mediates acanthosis in psoriasis and AD. On the other hand, Foxp3+ Treg cells attenuate immune responses partly via TGF-β or IL-10. Tissue resident memory T (Trm) cells  in the skin-most of which are epidermal CD8T cells-constitute the first line of the defense against repeated infections. CD8 T cells are also engaged in psoriasis, lichen planus, and drug eruptions. Skin harbors innate-like αβT cells  such as natural killer T (NKT) cells as well, whose function is not fully revealed. Understanding these αβT cells helps to comprehend skin diseases.  Copyright © 2014 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the skin lesions of atopic dermatitis (AD), keratinocytes release large quantities of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), causing unfavorable inflammation along with skin damage. Nevertheless, how TSLP influences keratinocytes themselves is still unknown. In this study, we showed that ΔNp63, a p53-homologue, predominantly expressed in keratinocytes regulated the receptor complex of TSLP, which determines susceptibility to self-derived TSLP. Expression of TSLP receptors in skin tissues and keratinocytes was assessed by immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR, and in vitro studies were also performed to examine the functional relevance of ΔNp63 in the expression of TSLP  receptors and the constituting autocrine and/or paracrine pathway of TSLP under the condition of stimuli to innate receptors sensing cell damage. The results showed that normal keratinocytes in the upper epidermis preferentially expressed  TSLP receptors and conversely lacked ΔNp63, which has an inhibitory effect on the expression of TSLP receptors. Interestingly, the epidermis of AD lesions was found to abundantly contain keratinocytes with low or undetectable levels of ΔNp63 (ΔNp63(lo/-)). Moreover, in the absence of ΔNp63, keratinocytes readily presented TSLP and other cytokines by stimuli through Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). Together with the evidence that extrinsic TSLP itself augments TSLP production by keratinocytes without ΔNp63, the results indicate that ΔNp63(lo/-)  keratinocytes generate TSLP through a putative autocrine and/or paracrine pathway upon TLR3 stimulation within AD lesions, since moieties of damaged cells and pathogens stimulate TLR3.

Patients with altered skin immunity, such as individuals with atopic dermatitis (AD), can have a life-threatening disruption of the epidermis known as eczema vaccinatum after vaccinia virus (VV) infection of the skin. Here, we sought to better understand the mechanism(s) by which VV associates with keratinocytes. The class A scavenger receptor known as MARCO (macrophage receptor with collagenous structure) is expressed on human and mouse keratinocytes and found to be abundantly expressed in the skin of patients with AD. VV bound directly to MARCO, and overexpression of MARCO increased susceptibility to VV infection. Furthermore, ligands with affinity for MARCO, or excess soluble MARCO, competitively inhibited VV infection. These findings indicate that MARCO promotes VV infection and highlights potential new therapeutic strategies for prevention of VV infection in the skin.

Staphylococcus aureus secretes extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are involved in AD pathogenesis. Here, we evaluated the role of EVs-associated α-hemolysin derived from S. aureus in AD pathogenesis. α-hemolysin production from S. aureus was detected using western blot analyses. The cytotoxic activity of α-hemolysin on HaCaT keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring cell viability after treating cells with soluble and EVs-associated α-hemolysin. To determine the type of cell death, HaCaT keratinocytes were stained with annexin V and 7-AAD. The in vivo effects of α-hemolysin were evaluated by application of soluble and EV-associated α-hemolysin on the mouse skin. The present study showed that increased α-hemolysin was produced by S. aureus colonized on AD patients compared to healthy subjects. α-hemolysin production was also related to AD severity. In addition, EV-associated α-hemolysin was more cytotoxic to HaCaT keratinocytes than soluble α-hemolysin, and α-hemolysin-negative EVs did not induce keratinocyte death. EV-associated α-hemolysin induced necrosis, but soluble α-hemolysin induced apoptosis of keratinocytes. In vivo, skin barrier disruption and epidermal hyperplasia were induced by soluble and EV-associated α-hemolysin. However, AD-like dermal inflammation was only caused by EV-associated α-hemolysin. Moreover, neither skin barrier disruption nor AD-like  skin inflammation was induced by α-hemolysin-negative EVs. Taken together, α-Hemolysin secreted from S. aureus, particularly the EV-associated form, induces both skin barrier disruption and AD-like skin inflammation, suggesting that EV-associated α-hemolysin is a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target for the control of AD.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by defects in the epidermal barrier and keratinocyte differentiation. The expression of filaggrin, a protein thought to have a major role in the function of the epidermis, is downregulated. However, the impact of this deficiency on keratinocytes is not really known. This was investigated using lentivirus-mediated small-hairpin RNA interference in a three-dimensional reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) model, in the absence of other cell types than keratinocytes. Similar to what is known for atopic skin, the experimental filaggrin downregulation resulted in hypogranulosis, a disturbed corneocyte intracellular matrix, reduced amounts of natural moisturizing factor components,  increased permeability and UV-B sensitivity of the RHE, and impaired keratinocyte differentiation at the messenger RNA and protein levels. In particular, the amounts of two filaggrin-related proteins and one protease involved in the degradation of filaggrin, bleomycin hydrolase, were lower. In addition, caspase-14 activation was reduced. These results demonstrate the importance of filaggrin for the stratum corneum properties/functions. They indicate that filaggrin downregulation in the epidermis of atopic patients, either acquired or  innate, may be directly responsible for some of the disease-related alterations in the epidermal differentiation program and epidermal barrier function.

Whether it also plays a role in human autoimmune inflammation and associated pathways is not known. OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated the potential role of several epithelium-derived factors, including TSLP, in inducing IL-23 production by human DCs. We further dissected the role of TSLP in patients with psoriasis, an IL-23-associated skin autoimmune disease. METHODS: The study was performed in human subjects using primary cells and tissue samples from patients with psoriasis and healthy donors. We analyzed the production of IL-23 in vitro by blood and skin DCs. We studied the function for TSLP and its interaction with other components of the inflammatory microenvironment in situ and ex vivo. RESULTS: We found that TSLP synergized with CD40 ligand to promote DC activation  and pathogenic IL-23 production by primary blood and skin DCs. In situ TSLP was strongly expressed by keratinocytes of untreated psoriatic lesions but not in normal skin. Moreover, we could demonstrate that IL-4, an important component of  the TH2 inflammation seen in patients with atopic dermatitis, inhibited IL-23 production induced by TSLP and CD40 ligand in a signal transducer and activator of transcription 6-independent manner. CONCLUSION: Our results identify TSLP as a novel player within the complex psoriasis cytokine network. Blocking TSLP in patients with psoriasis might contribute to decreasing DC activation and shutting down the production of pathogenic IL-23.  Copyright © 2014. Published by Mosby, Inc.

Niebuhr M(1), Baumert K, Heratizadeh A, Satzger I, Werfel T.  Author information:  (1)Division of Immunodermatology and Allergy Research, Department of Dermatology  and Allergy, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.  BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis patients are frequently colonized with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) that produce the staphylococcal  exotoxin α-toxin. However, only patients with AD suffer from bacterial superinfections with this pathogen, which implicates immunological differences in AD vs psoriasis in combating these bacteria. S. aureus recognition is partially mediated by intracellular nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain receptors (NLRs), which link α-toxin to caspase-1 activation through the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and to IL-1β secretion. OBJECTIVE: To investigate (i) NLRP3 expression in the context of different T-helper cytokine milieus and (ii) its function in response to sublytic α-toxin stimulation in patients with AD and psoriasis compared with healthy controls. METHODS: NLRP3 expression and function were investigated in lesional AD and psoriasis skin as well as in primary keratinocytes (HPKs) and monocytes upon stimulation with Th1, Th2, Th17 and Th22 cytokines or staphylococcal α-toxin, respectively, at the mRNA and protein (ELISA, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence) level. RESULTS: NLRP3 and caspase-1 expressions were reduced in lesional AD skin compared to psoriatic and healthy skin. IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 downregulated NLRP3  and ASC, whereas interferon-γ upregulated NLRP3 in HPKs. In monocytes, caspase-1  expression was reduced by Th2 cytokines and enhanced by a Th1 milieu. Caspase-1-dependent IL-1β secretion was impaired in monocytes from patients with  AD compared to patients with psoriasis and healthy controls by α-toxin stimulation following priming with lipoteichoic acid. CONCLUSION: Impaired NLRP3 expression and function may partially explain how skin colonization and infection with S. aureus can contribute to chronic skin inflammation in AD.  © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Environmental Medicine and Health Theory, University of Osnabrück, Osnabrück, Germany.  This viewpoint presents a unifying concept for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) that is based on the improvement of deficient Notch signalling, which appears to represent the fundamental epithelial defect of AD resulting in epidermal and immunological barrier dysfunction. One study of AD patients demonstrated a marked epidermal deficiency of Notch receptors and several mouse models with genetically suppressed Notch signalling exhibit dry skin, signs of scratching, skin barrier abnormalities, increased transepidermal water loss and Th2 cell-mediated immunological changes closely resembling human AD. Notch signalling is critically involved in the differentiation of regulatory T cells, in the feedback inhibition of activated innate immunity, in the repression of activating protein-1 (AP-1), the regulation of late epidermal differentiation associated with filaggrin- and stratum corneum barrier lipid processing, in aquaporin 3- and claudin-1 expression and in keratinocyte-mediated release of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), which promotes Th2-driven immune responses with TSLP- and IL-31-mediated stimulation of cutaneous sensory neurons involved in the induction of itch. Translational evidence will be provided that all major  therapeutic regimens employed for the treatment of AD such as glucocorticoids, calcineurin inhibitors and UV radiation may converge in the upregulation of impaired Notch signalling, the proposed pathogenic defect of AD.  © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The human cathelicidin LL-37 host defense peptide upregulates tight junction-related proteins and increases human epidermal keratinocyte barrier function.  Akiyama T(1), Niyonsaba F, Kiatsurayanon C, Nguyen TT, Ushio H, Fujimura T, Ueno  T, Okumura K, Ogawa H, Ikeda S.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.  Both psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD) are not only associated with an impaired stratum corneum barrier, but also with abnormal expression of the tight  junction (TJ) proteins. Because host defense peptides, including LL-37, are overexpressed in lesional psoriatic skin but are downregulated in lesional AD skin, we hypothesized that LL-37 might regulate the TJ function in keratinocytes. We demonstrated that LL-37 selectively increased the expression of several claudins and occludin, and enhanced their membrane distribution. Furthermore, LL-37 elevated the transepithelial electrical resistance while reducing the paracellular permeability of keratinocyte layers, and this activity was weakened  by the claudin inhibitor ochratoxin A. A characterization of the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of the TJ barrier by LL-37 revealed that LL-37 induced the activation of the Rac1, atypical PKC, glycogen synthase kinase-3 and PI3K pathways, and the specific inhibition of these pathways reversed the LL-37-mediated regulation of TJ function. In addition, LL-37 enhanced the expression of differentiation markers under the control of ochratoxin A, suggesting an association between LL-37-induced TJ function and keratinocyte differentiation. These data provide novel evidence that, in addition to its antimicrobial and other immunoregulatory functions, LL-37 contributes to cutaneous immunity by strengthening the skin's barrier function.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Environmental Medicine and Health Theory, University of Osnabrück, DE-49076 Osnabrück, Germany. Melnik@t-online.de.  This review presents recent evidence of impaired Notch signalling in atopic dermatitis (AD), which is proposed to represent the "a-topic" defect linking both epidermal and immunological barrier dysfunctions in AD. AD epidermis exhibits a marked deficiency of Notch receptors. Mouse models with genetically suppressed Notch signalling exhibit dry skin, signs of scratching, skin barrier abnormalities, increased transepidermal water loss and TH2 cell-mediated immunological changes closely resembling human AD. Notch signals are critically involved in the differentiation of regulatory T cells, in the feedback inhibition of activated innate immunity, in late epidermal differentiation associated with filaggrin- and stratum corneum barrier lipid processing. Most importantly, Notch  deficiency induces keratinocyte-mediated release of thymic stromal lymphopoietin  (TSLP). TSLP promotes TH2 cell-driven immune responses associated with enhanced production of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-31. Both TSLP and IL-31 stimulate sensory cutaneous neurons involved in the induction of itch. Notably, Notch1 is a repressor of activator protein-1 (AP-1), which is upregulated in AD epidermis. Without Notch-mediated suppression of AP-1 this transcription factor promotes excess expression of TH2 cell-related cytokines. Impaired Notch signalling negatively affects the homeostasis of aquaporin 3 and of the tight junction component claudin-1, thus explains disturbed skin barrier function with increased transepidermal water loss and Staphylococcus aureus colonisation as well as increased cutaneous susceptibility for viral infections. Thus, accumulating evidence links deficient Notch signalling to key pathological features of AD.  DOI: 10.2340/00015555-1898 	24853951

Atopic dermatitis can result from loss of structural proteins in the outermost epidermal layers, leading to a defective epidermal barrier. To test whether this  influences tumour formation, we chemically induced tumours in EPI-/- mice, which  lack three barrier proteins-Envoplakin, Periplakin, and Involucrin. EPI-/- mice were highly resistant to developing benign tumours when treated with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The DMBA response was normal, but EPI-/- skin exhibited an exaggerated atopic response to TPA, characterised by abnormal epidermal differentiation, a complex immune infiltrate and elevated serum thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). The exacerbated TPA response could be normalised by blocking TSLP or the immunoreceptor NKG2D but not CD4+ T cells. We conclude that atopy is protective against skin cancer in our experimental model and that the mechanism involves keratinocytes communicating with cells of the immune system via signalling elements that normally protect against environmental assaults.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01888.001.

CCR4+T cell recruitment to the skin in mycosis fungoides: potential contributions by thymic stromal lymphopoietin and interleukin-16.  Tuzova M(1), Richmond J, Wolpowitz D, Curiel-Lewandrowski C, Chaney K, Kupper T,  Cruikshank W.  Author information:  (1)Pulmonary Center.  Mycosis fungoides (MF) is characterized by skin accumulation of CCR4+CCR7- effector memory T cells; however the mechanism for their recruitment is not clearly identified. Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a keratinocyte-derived cytokine that triggers Th2 immunity and is associated with T cell recruitment to  the skin in atopic dermatitis. Interleukin-16 (IL-16) is a chemoattractant and growth factor for CD4+T cells. We hypothesized that TSLP and IL-16 could contribute to recruitment of malignant T cells in MF. We found elevated TSLP and  IL-16 in very early stage patients' plasma and skin biopsies, prior to elevation  in CCL22. Both TSLP and IL-16 induced migratory responses of CCR4+TSLPR+CD4+CCR7-CD31+cells, characteristic of malignant T cells in the skin.  Co-stimulation also resulted in significant proliferative responses. We conclude  that TSLP and IL-16, expressed at early stages of disease, function to recruit malignant T cells to the skin and contribute to their enhanced proliferation.

Author information:  (1)Department of Environmental Immuno-Dermatology, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.  Extracellular matrix (ECM) is not only involved in the maintenance of normal physiological tissue but also in interactions with other ECM components, tissue remodeling, and modulating immune responses. The skin provides a distinctive environment characterized by rich fibroblasts producing various ECM proteins, epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, and immune responses induced by external stimuli. Recently, periostin-a matricellular protein-has been highlighted for its pivotal functions in the skin. Analysis of periostin null mice has revealed that  periostin contributes to collagen fibrillogenesis, collagen cross-linking, and the formation of ECM meshwork via interactions with other ECM components. Periostin expression is enhanced by mechanical stress or skin injury; this is indicative of the physiologically protective functions of periostin, which promotes wound repair by acting on keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Along with its  physiological functions, periostin plays pathogenic roles in skin fibrosis and chronic allergic inflammation. In systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients, periostin levels reflect the severity of skin fibrosis. Periostin null mice have shown reduced skin fibrosis in a bleomycin-induced SSc mouse model, indicating a key role of periostin in fibrosis. Moreover, in atopic dermatitis (AD), attenuated AD phenotype has been observed in periostin null mice in a house dust mite extract-induced AD mouse model. Th2 cytokine-induced periostin acts on keratinocytes to produce inflammatory cytokines that further enhance the Th2 response, thereby sustaining and amplifying chronic allergic inflammation. Thus,  periostin is deeply involved in the pathogenesis of AD and other inflammation-related disorders affecting the skin. Understanding the dynamic actions of periostin would be key to dissecting pathogenesis of skin-related diseases and to developing novel therapeutic strategies.

Gaffal E(1), Glodde N, Jakobs M, Bald T, Tüting T.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Laboratory of Experimental Dermatology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.  Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by an impaired  epidermal barrier function combined with a chronic Th2-type inflammatory response and an intense pruritus. Here, we used an experimental mouse model for Th2-type contact hypersensitivity (CHS) to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) to investigate the potential role of cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1) in the pathophysiology of mouse atopic-like dermatitis. Mice lacking CB1 receptors globally (Cnr1(-/-) ) or specifically in keratinocytes (KC-Cnr1(-/-) ) as well as wild-type (WT) control mice were sensitized and challenged with FITC. We examined ear swelling responses, transepidermal water loss, Th2-type skin inflammatory responses and serum IgE levels. Both Cnr1(-/-) and KC-Cnr1(-/-) showed enhanced CHS responses to FITC and a delayed epidermal barrier repair when compared with WT mice. mRNA levels for IL-4, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and CCL8, as well as eosinophil activity, were significantly increased in inflamed ear tissue  of FITC-challenged Cnr1(-/-) and KC-Cnr1(-/-) mice. Importantly, CB1 receptor-deficient keratinocytes secreted increased levels of TSLP, a proinflammatory mediator that drives Th2-type skin inflammation in atopic dermatitis, under basal and Th2-type inflammatory conditions. Taken together, our results demonstrate that CB1 receptors in keratinocytes help to maintain epidermal barrier homoeostasis and attenuate Th2-type allergic inflammatory responses. Based on our work, we propose that enhanced epidermal allergen penetrance cooperates with increased production of TSLP and CCL8 by epidermal keratinocytes for the induction of type 2 CD4+ T helper cells. Our results place  keratinocytes at the cross-roads of outside-in and inside-out pathophysiologic mechanisms of atopic dermatitis.  © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

BACKGROUND: To understand the clinical segments of IL-31 signaling blockade therapy in pruritus of atopic dermatitis (AD), direct detection of the target proteins in the diseased tissues will provide crucial information. There is a lack of direct evidence concerning the cellular origin of IL-31 in AD skins, and  data on the expression of IL-31RA in AD are inconsistent. Also, there is no available information regarding IL-31RA protein expression in human dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which mediates the sensation of itch and is the long-suspected source of the protein. OBJECTIVE: We sought to obtain direct evidence concerning the distribution of IL-31- and IL-31RA-protein expressing cells and their characteristics in AD skin  samples and in human DRG. METHODS: IL-31 was detected immunohistochemically in AD skins, and representative sections were double stained with IL-31 and several immune-markers. IL-31RA was stained immunohistochemically in AD skins and normal human DRG, and representative AD skins were double stained with IL-31RA and PGP9.5 (a nerve marker). RESULTS: IL-31-positive cells were observed as mononuclear infiltrating cells and as CD11b co-expressing cells in severe AD samples. As for IL-31RA, positive reactions were detected in keratinocytes and nerve fibers in the dermis of AD and in the neurons of normal DRG. CONCLUSION: The detection of IL-31 in infiltrating cells of severe AD skin and of IL-31RA in nerve fibers of AD dermis and normal DRG indicates IL-31 signaling may be a contributing factor in the persistence and exacerbation of AD skin lesions.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.  The aim of the study was to investigate the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4 on keratinocytes in atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, and psoriasis by PCR and by immunohistochemistry including confocal microscopy. Confocal microscopy revealed a granular intra-cellular expression pattern for TLR 2 and a homogenous intra-cellular expression pattern for TLR 4 in normal and diseased skin. TLR 2 was constitutively expressed in the suprabasal layers in normal skin, but limited to the basal epidermis in diseased skin. TLR 4 expression was concentrated to the basal layers in normal skin, whereas it was pronounced in upper layers in diseased skin. The shift in the TLR expression may  be related to the disturbed skin barrier and a need for enhanced immune surveillance because of invading microbes. Also, there must be a balance between  sufficient immune response and overstimulation.  © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.  DOI: 10.1111/exd.12383 	24661005

Hyaluronan metabolism in human keratinocytes and atopic dermatitis skin is driven by a balance of hyaluronan synthases 1 and 3.

Author information:  (1)Research Unit of Molecular Physiology (URPHYM), NARILIS, University of Namur,  Namur, Belgium. (2)Department of Dermatology, University Medical Center of Liège, Liège, Belgium.  Hyaluronan (HA) is a glycosaminoglycan synthesized directly into the extracellular matrix by three hyaluronan synthases (HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3). HA is  abundantly synthesized by keratinocytes but its epidermal functions remain unclear. We used culture models to grow human keratinocytes as autocrine monolayers or as reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) to assess HA synthesis and HAS expression levels during the course of keratinocyte differentiation. In both  the models, epidermal differentiation downregulates HAS3 mRNA expression while increasing HAS1 without significant changes in hyaluronidase expression. HA production correlates with HAS1 mRNA expression level during normal differentiation. To investigate the regulation of HAS gene expression during inflammatory conditions linked to perturbed differentiation, lesional and non-lesional skin biopsies of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients were analyzed. HAS3 mRNA expression level increases in AD lesions compared with healthy and non-lesional skin. Simultaneously, HAS1 expression decreases. Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is upregulated in AD epidermis. An AD-like HAS expression pattern is observed in RHE incubated with HB-EGF. These results indicate that HAS1 is the main enzyme responsible for HA production by normal keratinocytes and thus, must be considered as an actor of normal keratinocyte differentiation. In contrast, HAS3 can be induced by HB-EGF and seems mainly involved in AD epidermis.  DOI: 10.1038/jid.2014.147 	24658508

(2)Atopy (Allergy) Research Center, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.  Human β-defensins (hBDs) are host defense peptides that not only exhibit microbicidal properties but also stimulate various cellular activities, including keratinocyte proliferation, migration, and wound healing. hBDs are overexpressed  in the skin in cases of psoriasis but are downregulated in atopic dermatitis skin, although both diseases are associated with stratum corneum barrier defects. Because the tight-junction (TJ) barrier is also dysfunctional in both atopic dermatitis and psoriasis patients, we hypothesized that hBDs may regulate the TJ  barrier function in keratinocytes. We observed that, among the hBDs tested, only  hBD-3 increased the expression of several claudins and their localization along the cell-cell borders. In addition, hBD-3 elevated the transepithelial electrical resistance and reduced the paracellular permeability of keratinocyte layers, and  this effect was reversed by the claudin inhibitor ochratoxin A, CCR6 antibody, and CCR6 small interfering RNA. Moreover, hBD-3 enhanced the activation of Rac1,  atypical protein kinase C, glycogen synthase kinase-3, and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, which are required for the hBD-3-mediated regulation of the TJ barrier function, as evidenced by the effects of their respective inhibitors. Collectively, our findings provide evidence regarding the contribution of host defense peptides to the innate immunity of skin by regulating TJ barrier function, in addition to their antimicrobial and other immunomodulatory activities.

Quercetagetin inhibits macrophage-derived chemokine in HaCaT human keratinocytes  via the regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1, suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 and transforming growth factor-β1.  Kang GJ(1), Han SC, Kang NJ, Koo DH, Park DB, Eun SY, Kang HK, Yoo ES.  Author information:  (1)Department of Pharmacology and, Jeju National University, Jeju, Korea.  BACKGROUND: Inflammatory chemokines, such as macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22), are elevated in the serum and lesioned skin of patients with atopic  dermatitis (AD), and are ligands for C-C chemokine receptor 4, which is predominantly expressed on T helper 2 lymphocytes, basophils and natural killer cells. We have previously reported that quercetagetin has an inhibitory activity  on inflammatory chemokines, which is induced by interferon (IFN)-γ and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, occurring via inhibition of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) signal. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the specific mechanisms of quercetagetin on the STAT1  signal. METHODS: We confirmed the inhibitory activity of quercetagetin on MDC and STAT1 in HaCaT keratinocytes. The interaction between STAT1 and IFN-γR1 was investigated using immunoprecipitation. The small interfering RNA approach was used to investigate the role of suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS1) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 induced by quercetagetin. RESULTS: Quercetagetin inhibited the expression of MDC at both the protein and mRNA levels in IFN-γ- and TNF-α-stimulated HaCaT human keratinocytes. Moreover, quercetagetin inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT1 through upregulation of SOCS1. Increased expression of SOCS1 disrupted the binding of STAT1 to IFN-γR1. Furthermore, quercetagetin augmented the expression of TGF-β1, which is known to  modulate the immune response and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that quercetagetin may be a potent inhibitor of the STAT1 signal, which could be a new molecular target for anti-inflammatory  treatment, and may thus have therapeutic applications as an immune modulator in inflammatory diseases such as AD.  © 2014 British Association of Dermatologists.

Ceramide is important for water retention and permeability barrier functions in the stratum corneum, and plays a key role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD). A Pseudomonas aeruginosa-derived neutral ceramidase (PaCDase) isolated from a patient with AD was shown to effectively degrade ceramide in the  presence of Staphylococcus aureus-derived lipids or neutral detergents. However,  the effect of ceramide metabolites on the functions of differentiating keratinocytes is poorly understood. We found that the ceramide metabolite sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) stimulated the production of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and IL-8 from three-dimensionally cultured human primary keratinocytes (termed "3D keratinocytes"), which form a stratum corneum. PaCDase  alone did not affect TNF-α gene expression in 3D keratinocytes. In the presence of the detergent Triton X-100, which damages stratum corneum structure, PaCDase,  but not heat-inactivated PaCDase or PaCDase-inactive mutant, induced the production of TNF-α, endothelin-1, and IL-8, indicating that this production was  dependent on ceramidase activity. Among various ceramide metabolites, sphingosine and S1P enhanced the gene expression of TNF-α, endothelin-1, and IL-8. The PaCDase-enhanced expression of these genes was inhibited by a sphingosine kinase  inhibitor and by an S1P receptor antagonist VPC 23019. The TNF-α-binding antibody infliximab suppressed the PaCDase-induced upregulation of IL-8, but not TNF-α, mRNA. PaCDase induced NF-κB p65 phosphorylation. The NF-κB inhibitor curcumin significantly inhibited PaCDase-induced expression of IL-8 and endothelin-1. VPC  23019 and infliximab inhibited PaCDase-induced NF-κB p65 phosphorylation and reduction in the protein level of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα. Collectively, these findings suggest that (i) 3D keratinocytes produce S1P from sphingosine, which is produced through the hydrolysis of ceramide by PaCDase, (ii) S1P induces the production of TNF-α via S1P receptors, and (iii) released TNF-α stimulates the production of inflammatory mediators such as IL-8.

Balato A(1), Paoletti I, De Gregorio V, Cantelli M, Ayala F, Donnarumma G.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.  Topical immunosuppressant therapy is widely used in the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Besides its beneficial therapeutic effects, application of topical anti-inflammatory drugs may render the epidermis more vulnerable to invading pathogens by suppressing innate immune  responses in keratinocytes (KCs). Cytokines, chemokines and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) produced by epithelial cells enable them to participate in innate and acquired immune responses. The aim of the present work was to study the influence of tacrolimus (FK506) on KCs infected with Malassezia furfur (M. furfur), evaluating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1α and IL-6,  chemokine IL-8, anti-inflammatory cytokines transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-β1) and IL-10 and AMP β-defensin-2. Human KCs were obtained from surgical specimens of normal adult skin. The expression of mRNAs in KCs: FK506-treated, FK506-treated and M. furfur-infected as well as only M. furfur-infected was quantified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Next, the production of the AMP β-defensin-2 and of the above-mentioned pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines was evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In this study, FK506 did not alter cytokine and AMP production by KCs; this led us to hypothesise that it may not enhance the risk of mycotic skin infections.  © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

Th2 cytokines increase Staphylococcus aureus alpha toxin-induced keratinocyte death through the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6).  Brauweiler AM(1), Goleva E(1), Leung DY(1).  Author information:  (1)Department of Pediatrics, National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado, USA.  Comment in     J Invest Dermatol. 2014 Aug;134(8):2069-71.  Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory skin disease characterized by increased T-helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine expression. AD skin lesions are often exacerbated  by Staphylococcus aureus-mediated secretion of the lytic virulence factor, alpha  toxin. In the current study, we report that alpha toxin-induced cell death is greater in the skin from patients with AD compared with controls. Furthermore, we find that keratinocyte differentiation and Th2 cytokine exposure influence sensitivity to S. aureus alpha toxin-induced cell death. Differentiated keratinocytes are protected from cell death, whereas cells treated with Th2 cytokines have increased sensitivity to alpha toxin-induced lethality. Our data demonstrate that the downstream effects mediated by Th2 cytokines are dependent upon host expression of STAT6. We determine that Th2 cytokines induce biochemical changes that decrease levels of acid sphingomyelinase (SMase), an enzyme that cleaves sphingomyelin, an alpha toxin receptor. Furthermore, Th2 cytokines inhibit the production of lamellar bodies, organelles critical for epidermal barrier formation. Finally, we determine that SMase and its enzymatic product, phosphocholine, prevent Th2-mediated increases in alpha toxin-induced cell death. Therefore, our studies may help explain the increased propensity for Th2 cytokines to exacerbate S. aureus-induced skin disease, and provide a potential therapeutic target for treatment of AD.

Electronic address: wbaeumer@ncsu.edu.  Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) modulates many cell functions such as lymphocyte trafficking and signaling as well as keratinocyte proliferation. However, less is known about the specific effects of S1P on cytokine production, particularly on the interaction between dendritic cells (DCs) and keratinocytes, cell types which are crucial for the initiation and maintenance of chronic inflammatory skin diseases like atopic dermatitis or psoriasis. Especially the cytokines of the IL-12 family play a dominant role in many inflammatory diseases as they have a significant impact on T-helper cell function. In the present study we show that S1P decreased the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 in LPS-stimulated DCs via the common subunit p40 as well as in the crosstalk with activated keratinocytes. By using specific S1P receptor agonists (SEW2871, FTY720-P) and antagonist (JTE013) we identified an important role for S1P receptor 1 in the modulation of the cytokine profile. While diminishing IL-12 and IL-23 secretion, S1P enhanced IL-27 production in DCs. To elucidate the mechanism of the different impact on the IL-12 family cytokine production, we investigated  the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways in DCs. By using specific MAPK-Inhibitors (U0126, SB202190, SP600125) we demonstrated that ERK, p38 and JNK differently regulate each pathway of each cytokine. While p38 and JNK did not seem to play a role in the modulation properties of S1P on cytokine production, ERK is at least partially involved in the S1P mediated modulation of IL-12 and IL-27. The PI3K-Inhibitor abrogated the  S1P-induced decrease of IL-12 and IL-23 secretion, while it had no influence on the S1P-induced increase of IL-27 production. These data implicate, that S1P has  an anti-inflammatory impact on the production of IL-12 family cytokines, indicating therapeutic potential for S1P treatment of several inflammatory diseases like psoriasis.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Allergy, and Venereology, University of Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany.  Leukotrienes constitute a group of lipid mediators, which may be subdivided into  two groups, with leukotriene B4 on the one hand and cysteinyl leukotrienes on the other. Although leukotrienes are abundantly expressed in skin affected by diverse chronic inflammatory diseases, including atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, pemphigus  vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid, their pathological roles in these diseases have  remained elusive. Recent data now reveal that both leukotriene B4 and cysteinyl leukotrienes are indispensable in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, with leukotriene B4 initiating the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly neutrophils and TH 2 cells into the skin, and cysteinyl leukotrienes later inducing characteristic structural alterations of chronically affected skin, specifically skin fibrosis and keratinocyte proliferation. Thus, these results reveal a sequential cooperation of LTB4 and cysteinyl leukotrienes to initiate and perpetuate allergic skin inflammation. These new insights highlight leukotrienes as promising therapeutic targets in allergic skin inflammation and should encourage more research into the role of leukotrienes in other inflammatory skin diseases.  © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is found on the skin of approximately 90% of patients with atopic dermatitis and approximately 20% of apparently healthy subjects. S. aureus induces keratinocytes and immune cells to  secrete immunoregulatory factors that cause epidermal barrier dysfunction in atopic skin. OBJECTIVE: This study examined factors that cause epidermal permeability barrier  dysfunction in skin colonized by S. aureus. METHODS: We examined the effect of S. aureus on keratinocyte differentiation in the stratum corneum (SC) of in vivo skin, normal human keratinocytes (NHKs) and a reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) model. The fold change in expression of the terminal differentiation markers and the level of secreted cytokines were investigated. RESULTS: The SC displayed decreased expression of keratin 10 (KRT 10). NHKs treated with S. aureus extracts increased expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and significantly reduced expression of the terminal differentiation markers KRT 1, KRT 10, loricrin (LOR), and filaggrin (FLG); however, the expression of basal layer markers (KRT 5, KRT 14) remained unchanged. Treatment of NHKs with an anti-IL-6 antibody in combination with IL-6 or the S. aureus extracts inhibited the decrease in KRT 10 mRNA or protein expression. After the RHEs were exposed to the S. aureus extracts, KRT 1 and KRT 10 protein levels decreased. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that S. aureus inhibits the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes by stimulating IL-6 secretion.

The skin epidermis and mucosal epithelia (airway, ocular tissues, gut, and so on) are located at the interface between the body and environment and have critical roles in the response to various stimuli. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a  cytokine expressed mainly by epidermal keratinocytes (KCs) and mucosal epithelial cells, is a critical factor linking the innate response at barrier surfaces to Th2-skewed acquired immune response. TSLP is highly expressed in skin lesions of  atopic dermatitis patients. Here, we describe on Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated induction of TSLP expression in primary cultured human KCs, placing emphasis on experimental methods used in our studies. Double-stranded RNA (TLR3 ligand), flagellin (TLR5 ligand), and diacylated lipopeptide (TLR2-TLR6 ligand) stimulated human KCs to express TSLP and Staphylococcus aureus membranes  did so via the TLR2-TLR6 pathway. Atopic cytokine milieu upregulated the TLR-mediated induction of TSLP. Culturing in the absence of glucocorticoid before stimulation enhanced the TSLP expression. Extracellular double-stranded RNA induced TSLP via endosomal acidification- and NF-κB-dependent pathway. Specific measurement of the long TSLP transcript, which contributes to the production of the TSLP protein, rather than total or the short transcript is useful for accurate detection of functional human TSLP gene expression. The results suggest  that environment-, infection-, and/or self-derived TLR ligands contribute to the  initiation and/or amplification of Th2-type skin inflammation including atopic dermatitis and atopic march through the induction of TSLP expression in KCs and include information helpful for understanding the role of the gene-environment interaction relevant in allergic diseases.  © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Increased expression of the histamine H4 receptor following differentiation and mediation of the H4 receptor on interleukin-8 mRNA expression in HaCaT keratinocytes.  Suwa E(1), Yamaura K, Sato S, Ueno K.  Author information:  (1)Department of Geriatric Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Chuo-ku, Chiba, Japan.  Recent in vivo studies have demonstrated involvement of the histamine H4 receptor in pruritus and skin inflammation. We previously reported that an H4 receptor antagonist attenuated scratching behaviour and improved skin lesions in an experimental model of atopic dermatitis. We also reported the expression of the H4 receptor in human epidermal tissues. In this study, we investigated the expression of H4 receptor mRNA and the function of the receptor in a culture system that mimics in vivo inflammation on the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line. Increased expression of the H4 receptor was observed in HaCaT cells following differentiation. Treatment of HaCaT cells with histamine and TNFα enhanced the mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-8. These increases in expression were significantly inhibited by the H4 receptor antagonist JNJ7777120. Our results indicate that IL-8 mRNA expression might be enhanced by histamine and TNFα via H4 receptor stimulation in keratinocytes.  © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes are normally well balanced, but this balance can be perturbed in wound healing and is dysregulated in pathological conditions such as atopic dermatitis. Epithelial-mesenchymal interaction affects this event via the cross-talk of cytokines and growth factors. Periostin, a matricellular protein, has an important role during reepithelialization in wound healing and is critical for hyperproliferation of keratinocytes in atopic dermatitis. Here we investigated how periostin regulates  proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes in the epithelial-mesenchymal  interactions using a three-dimensional organotypic air-liquid interface coculture system. The release of IL-1α from keratinocytes and subsequent IL-6 production from fibroblasts were critical for keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. Periostin secreted from fibroblasts was required for IL-1α-induced IL-6 production and enhanced IL-6 production by activation of the NF-κB pathway synergistically with IL-1α. Thus, the combination of an autocrine loop of periostin and a paracrine loop composed of IL-1α and IL-6 regulates keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation in the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, and periostin tunes the magnitude of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation by interacting with the paracrine IL-1α/IL-6 loop.

Luo Y(1), Zhou B, Zhao M, Tang J, Lu Q.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Hunan Children's Hospital, Changsha, Hunan, China.  BACKGROUND: Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) plays an important role in promoting T-cell homeostasis, and appears to be a central player in the development of allergic symptoms, especially in asthma and atopic dermatitis (AD). Human TSLP is overexpressed in keratinocytes of patients with acute and chronic AD. However, the mechanism of TSLP overexpression remains unclear. AIM: To investigate whether TSLP expression is regulated by aberrant DNA methylation modification of the TSLP promoter in keratinocytes of patients with AD. METHODS: mRNA and protein levels of TSLP in lesional skin samples from 10 children with AD and 10 healthy controls were measured by real-time quantitative  reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Bisulfite sequencing was performed to determine the methylation status of the TSLP promoter, and 5-azacytidine (5-aza), a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, was used to determine the influence of DNA methylation on TSLP expression. RESULTS: TSLP mRNA and protein expression levels were increased in skin lesions from patients with AD compared with healthy controls. Moreover, promoter hypomethylation of the TSLP gene was identified in skin lesions from patients with AD, and treating keratinocytes with 5-aza reduced the methylation level of the TSLP promoter and increased TSLP transcription. CONCLUSIONS: DNA demethylation of a specific regulatory region of the TSLP gene may contribute to TSLP overexpression in skin lesions in patients with AD.  © 2013 British Association of Dermatologists.

EGFR signaling blunts allergen-induced IL-6 production and Th17 responses in the  skin and attenuates development and relapse of atopic dermatitis.  Zhang Z(1), Xiao C, Gibson AM, Bass SA, Khurana Hershey GK.  Author information:  (1)Division of Asthma Research, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45229.  Despite the important role for epidermal growth factor (EGF) in epithelial homeostasis and wound healing, it has not been investigated in atopic dermatitis  (AD). We used AD animal models to explore the role of EGF in AD. In an acute AD model, skin transepidermal water loss was significantly attenuated in EGF-treated mice. Blockade of EGFR signaling genetically or pharmacologically confirms a protective role for EGFR signaling in AD. In a chronic/relapsing AD model, EGF treatment of mice with established AD resulted in an attenuation of AD exacerbation (skin epithelial thickness, cutaneous inflammation, and total and allergen specific IgE) following cutaneous allergen rechallenge. EGF treatment did not alter expression of skin barrier junction proteins or antimicrobial peptides in the AD model. However, EGF treatment attenuated allergen-induced expression of IL-17A, CXCL1, and CXCL2 and neutrophil accumulation in AD skin following cutaneous allergen exposure. IL-17A production was decreased in the in  vitro restimulated skin-draining lymph node cells from the EGF-treated mice. Similarly, IL-17A was increased in waved-2 mice skin following allergen exposure. Whereas IL-6 and IL-1β expression was attenuated in the skin of EGF-treated mice, EGF treatment also suppressed allergen-induced IL-6 production by keratinocytes.  Given the central role of IL-6 in priming Th17 differentiation in the skin, this  effect of EGF on keratinocytes may contribute to the protective roles for EGFR in AD pathogenesis. In conclusion, our study provides evidence for a previously unrecognized protective role for EGF in AD and a new role for EGF in modulating IL-17 responses in the skin.

T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, attenuate the expression of genes that regulate epidermal cellular structures and the barrier function at the terminal stage of keratinocyte differentiation. However, whether these Th2 cytokines act at earlier stages remains unknown. We investigated the roles of cytokines in expression levels of mRNAs and/or proteins in primary mouse keratinocytes and human keratinocyte HaCaT cells at earlier stages. We showed that IL-4 downregulated the expression levels of Krt1, Krt10, Dsg1, and Dsc1 via  IL-4Rα- and signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 6 (STAT6)-dependent mechanisms in differentiating mouse keratinocytes at early stages. As the expression levels of keratin-1 and -10 in the keratinocytes transiently expressing an active form of STAT6 were not downregulated, STAT6 and  other IL-4-induced molecules may synergistically regulate this expression. The restoration of the downregulated expression levels of Krt1 and Krt10 induced by IL-4 with the MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) inhibitor U0126 indicated the involvement of the  p44/42 MAPK signaling pathway in the attenuated expression. IL-13 also downregulated the expression of the four genes. Furthermore, IL-4 or IL-13 caused the downregulation of these genes in HaCaT cells and promoted the fragmentation of cell sheets with mechanical stress. Our results showed that IL-4 or IL-13 acted on differentiating keratinocytes in vitro at early stages to attenuate the  gene expression.  DOI: 10.1038/jid.2013.503 	24280725

Guo L(1), Chen H, Li Y, Zhou Q, Sui Y.  Author information:  (1)Key Laboratory of Pollution Processes and Environmental Criteria, College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.  Aquaporin 3 (AQP3) is an aquaglyceroporin which transports water, glycerol and small solutes across the plasma membrane. Its functions are not limited to fluid  transport but also involve the regulation of cell proliferation, migration, skin  hydration, wound healing and tumorigenesis. While AQP3 has been reported to play  an important role in keratinocyte proliferation, its role in differentiation remains controversial. Our study demonstrated that the expression of AQP3 was regulated during differentiation and that it participated in keratinocyte differentiation control. We further revealed that AQP3 was a transcriptional target of Notch signaling, a critical pathway regulating keratinocyte differentiation and tumor suppression, and it regulated differentiation through a reciprocal negative feedback loop with Notch1. When the expression level of AQP3  was elevated, impaired barrier integrity and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine  production ensued, mimicking the pathological conditions in Notch deficient mice  and in atopic dermatitis. Dysregulation of AQP3 and Notch receptors has been reported in several skin diseases, including skin cancer. Our discovery of the novel AQP3-Notch1 axis may provide insight into epidermal homeostasis control and possible translational applications, including its potential use as a biomarker for molecular diagnosis in environmental studies.

Comment in     Cell. 2013 Oct 10;155(2):267-9.     Trends Immunol. 2014 Feb;35(2):49-50.  Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic itch and inflammatory disorder of the skin that affects one in ten people. Patients suffering from severe AD eventually progress to develop asthma and allergic rhinitis, in a process known as the "atopic march." Signaling between epithelial cells and innate immune cells via the cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is thought to drive AD and the atopic march. Here, we report that epithelial cells directly communicate to cutaneous sensory neurons via TSLP to promote itch. We identify the ORAI1/NFAT calcium signaling pathway as an essential regulator of TSLP release from keratinocytes, the primary epithelial cells of the skin. TSLP then acts directly  on a subset of TRPA1-positive sensory neurons to trigger robust itch behaviors. Our results support a model whereby calcium-dependent TSLP release by keratinocytes activates both primary afferent neurons and immune cells to promote inflammatory responses in the skin and airways.

BACKGROUND: Nonsense mutations in filaggrin (FLG) represent a significant genetic factor in the cause of atopic dermatitis (AD). OBJECTIVE: It is of great importance to find drug candidates that upregulate FLG  expression and to determine whether increased FLG expression controls the development of AD. METHODS: We screened a library of bioactives by using an FLG reporter assay to find candidates that promoted FLG mRNA expression using a human immortalized keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT). We studied the effect of the compound on keratinocytes using the human skin equivalent model. We examined the effect of the compound on AD-like skin inflammation in NC/Nga mice. RESULTS: JTC801 promoted FLG mRNA and protein expression in both HaCaT and normal human epidermal keratinocytes. Intriguingly, JTC801 promoted the mRNA and protein expression levels of FLG but not the mRNA levels of other makers for keratinocyte differentiation, including loricrin, keratin 10, and transglutaminase 1, in a human skin equivalent model. In addition, oral administration of JTC801 promoted  the protein level of Flg and suppressed the development of AD-like skin inflammation in NC/Nga mice. CONCLUSION: This is the first observation that the compound, which increased FLG  expression in human and murine keratinocytes, attenuated the development of AD-like skin inflammation in mice. Our findings provide evidence that modulation  of FLG expression can be a novel therapeutic target for AD.  Copyright © 2013 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Published by Mosby, Inc.

Epidermal tight junctions (TJs) have been well characterized in human medicine. Abnormality of these structures is involved in skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis. There is little information about the expression and distribution of  TJ proteins in the canine skin. The aim of this study was to develop an optimal immunohistochemical method for assessment of the expression of TJ proteins in the skin of healthy dogs. Formalin-fixed and paraffin wax-embedded skin biopsy samples from healthy human and canine patients were used. Canine skin samples were from the inguinal region and the nasal planum. Immunohistochemistry was used to study the expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin and claudin-1, -4  and -7. Heat-induced antigen retrieval with EDTA (pH 9.0) yielded the best labelling of TJ proteins. ZO-1 and occludin were expressed in the cytoplasm and along the keratinocyte membrane, while claudin-1 and -4 were mainly membrane in distribution. ZO-1, occludin and claudin-1 were detected in all epidermal layers  with the exception of the stratum corneum, while claudin-4 expression was restricted to the stratum granulosum. Expression of claudin-7 was difficult to evaluate. There was no difference in labelling pattern between inguinal and nasal planum skin.  Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Histamine induces proliferation in keratinocytes from patients with atopic dermatitis through the histamine 4 receptor.  Glatzer F(1), Gschwandtner M, Ehling S, Rossbach K, Janik K, Klos A, Bäumer W, Kietzmann M, Werfel T, Gutzmer R.  Author information:  (1)Division of Immunodermatology and Allergy Research, Department of Dermatology  and Allergy, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. Electronic address: Glatzer.Franziska@mh-hannover.de.  BACKGROUND: Epidermal hyperproliferation resulting in acanthosis is an important  clinical observation in patients with atopic dermatitis, and its underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. OBJECTIVE: Because increased levels of histamine are present in lesional skin, we investigated the effect of histamine, especially with regard to histamine 4 receptor (H4R) activation, on the proliferation of human and murine keratinocytes. METHODS: The expression of H4R on human and murine keratinocytes was detected by  using real-time PCR. Keratinocyte proliferation was evaluated by using different  in vitro cell proliferation assays, scratch assays, and measurement of the epidermal thickness of murine skin. RESULTS: We detected H4R mRNA on foreskin keratinocytes and on outer root sheath  keratinocytes; H4R mRNA was more abundant in keratinocytes from patients with atopic dermatitis compared with those from nonatopic donors. Stimulation of foreskin keratinocytes, atopic dermatitis outer root sheath keratinocytes, and H4R-transfected HaCaT cells with histamine and H4R agonist resulted in an increase in proliferation, which was blocked with the H4R-specific antagonist JNJ7777120. Abdominal epidermis of H4R-deficient mice was significantly thinner,  and the in vitro proliferation of keratinocytes derived from H4R-deficient mice was lower compared with that seen in control mice. Interestingly, we only detected H4R expression on murine keratinocytes after stimulation with LPS and peptidoglycan. CONCLUSION: H4R is highly expressed on keratinocytes from patients with atopic dermatitis, and its stimulation induces keratinocyte proliferation. This might represent a mechanism that contributes to the epidermal hyperplasia observed in patients with atopic dermatitis.  Copyright © 2013 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Signaling via the IL-20 receptor inhibits cutaneous production of IL-1β and IL-17A to promote infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Staphylococcus aureus causes most infections of human skin and soft tissue and is a major infectious cause of mortality. Host defense mechanisms against S. aureus  are incompletely understood. Interleukin 19 (IL-19), IL-20 and IL-24 signal through type I and type II IL-20 receptors and are associated with inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. We found here that those cytokines promoted cutaneous infection with S. aureus in mice by downregulating IL-1β- and IL-17A-dependent pathways. We noted similar effects of those cytokines in human keratinocytes after exposure to S. aureus, and antibody blockade of the  IL-20 receptor improved outcomes in infected mice. Our findings identify an immunosuppressive role for IL-19, IL-20 and IL-24 during infection that could be  therapeutically targeted to alter susceptibility to infection.

Kim IS(1), Kim MJ, Shin DH, Son KH, Park HY, Lee JS.  Author information:  (1)Department of Biomedical Laboratory Science, School of Medicine, Eulji University, Daejeon, Chungnam 301‑746, Republic of Korea.  In the present study, the inhibitory effect of arazyme on allergic inflammation was investigated by evaluating the alteration of cytokine production and expression of skin barrier proteins in immune and HaCaT human keratinocyte cells. THP‑1 human monocytic and EoL‑1 human eosinophilic cells were treated with Dermatophagoides pteronissinus extract (DpE). Monocyte chemotactic protein‑1 (MCP‑1)/CCL2, interleukin (IL)‑6 and IL‑8 increased following DpE treatment and arazyme significantly blocked the increase of MCP‑1, IL‑6 and IL‑8 expression in  cell types. Secretion of MCP‑1, IL‑6 and IL‑8 induced by lipopolysaccharide in THP‑1 cells was also inhibited by arazyme treatment. Arazyme inhibited the secretion of IL‑6 and IL‑8 due to phorbol 12‑myristate 13‑acetate and calcium ionophores in human mast cells. Arazyme blocked the secretion of thymus and activation‑regulated chemokine (TARC)/CCL17, MCP‑1, IL‑6 and IL‑8 due to tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α) and interferon‑γ (IFN‑γ) in HaCaT cells. TNF‑α and IFN‑γ suppressed the expression of skin barrier proteins, including filaggrin, involucrin and loricrin. By contrast, arazyme increased the expression of filaggrin, involucrin and loricrin. These results may contribute to the development of a therapeutic drug for the treatment of allergic diseases, including atopic dermatitis.  DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2013.1520 	23764888

Deing V(1), Roggenkamp D, Kühnl J, Gruschka A, Stäb F, Wenck H, Bürkle A, Neufang G.  Author information:  (1)Beiersdorf AG, Research Skin Care, Hamburg, Germany.  The neuropeptide hormone oxytocin (OXT) mediates a wide spectrum of tissue-specific actions, ranging from cell growth, cell differentiation, sodium excretion to stress responses, reproduction and complex social behaviour. Recently, OXT expression was detected in keratinocytes, but expression of its receptor and function are still unexplored in human skin. Here, we showed that both OXT and its receptor are expressed in primary human dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes. OXT-induced dose-dependent calcium fluxes in both cell types demonstrating that the OXT receptor (OXTR) is functionally expressed. We also showed that OXT decreases proliferation of dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes in a dose-dependent manner. In order to further investigate OXT-mediated functions in skin cells, we performed OXTR knockdown experiments. OXTR knockdown  in dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes led to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and reduced levels of glutathione (GSH). Moreover, OXTR-depleted keratinocytes exhibited an increased release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6, CCL5 and CXCL10. Our data indicate that the OXT system modulates key processes which are dysregulated in atopic dermatitis (AD) such as proliferation, inflammation and oxidative stress responses. Furthermore, we detected a downregulation of the OXT system in peri-lesional and lesional atopic skin. Taken together, these data suggest that the OXT system is a novel neuroendocrine mediator in human skin homoeostasis and clinically relevant to stressed skin conditions like AD.  © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University Hospital, Duesseldorf, Germany.  BACKGROUND: Recent studies provided insights into the recruitment and activation  pathways of leukocytes in atopic dermatitis, however, the underlying mechanisms of tissue remodeling in atopic skin inflammation remain elusive. OBJECTIVE: To identify chemokine-mediated communication pathways regulating tissue remodeling during atopic skin inflammation. METHODS: Analysis of the chemokine receptor repertoire of human dermal fibroblasts using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analyses of chemokine expression in atopic vs. non-atopic skin inflammation. Investigation of the function of chemokine receptor CCR3 on human dermal fibroblasts through determining intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization, cell proliferation, migration, and repair capacity. RESULTS: Analyses on human dermal fibroblasts showed abundant expression of the chemokine receptor CCR3 in vitro and in vivo. Among its corresponding ligands (CCL5, CCL8, CCL11, CCL24 and CCL26) CCL26 demonstrated a significant and specific up-regulation in atopic when compared to psoriatic skin inflammation. In vivo, epidermal keratinocytes showed most abundant CCL26 protein expression in lesional atopic skin. In structural cells of the skin, TH2-cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 were dominant inducers of CCL26 expression. In dermal fibroblasts, CCL26 induced CCR3 signaling resulting in intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization, as well as enhanced fibroblast migration and repair capacity, but no proliferation. CONCLUSION: Taken together, findings of the present study suggest that chemokine-driven communication pathways from the epidermis to the dermis may modulate tissue remodeling in atopic skin inflammation.

Author information:  (1)Service de Dermatologie, CHU de Brest, 2, avenue Foch, 29200 Brest, France. laurent.misery@chu-brest.fr  Dermatological research is more and more productive and its level higher and higher. Choosing the most significant articles is difficult. Mast cell plays a role in the initiation of inflammation and therefore in poorer healing. Keratinocytes derive from stem cells and progenitors, which are independent. They can be activated directly by heat through sensory proteins at their surface. The  cutaneous nervous system has an organization similar to that of the most complex  sensory organs. In psoriasis, denervation induces a significant plaque regression. The cerebral integration of skin appearance modulates the skin reactivity to histamine. Pruritus is linked to specific receptors in the skin, which give specific projections into the brain and are histamine-dependent or not. Atopic dermatitis may be linked to the nonspecific activation of Th2 immune  system, particularly to abnormalities of the skin barrier. Skin bacteria, but not intestinal, modulate the formation of skin immunity. Raf kinases are well known in melanoma and play an important role in physiological conditions: they are not  essential to the initial development of the melanocyte lineage but to maintain it. In culture, melanocytes can be dedifferentiated in melanoblasts. Sunburns are consecutive to the activation of TLR3 by UVB. ANRIL gene is involved in the polymorphism of neurofibromatosis 1 and gene RAD51B is linked to the risk of male breast cancer. MCV infection is linked to sites with sialic acid. Aging objectified by telomere shortening is accelerated by stress.  Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.  DOI: 10.1016/S0151-9638(12)70133-3 	23522705

Human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 modulates proinflammatory responses induced by  cytokine milieus and double-stranded RNA in human keratinocytes.  Chen X(1), Takai T, Xie Y, Niyonsaba F, Okumura K, Ogawa H.  Author information:  (1)Atopy (Allergy) Research Center, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo 113-8421, Japan.  Epidermal keratinocytes produce proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines upon stimulation with cytokine milieus and Toll-like receptor ligands, which are considered to reflect epidermal environments in inflamed skin. The human antimicrobial peptide LL-37, besides having microbicidal functions, plays multiple roles as a "host defense peptide" in the immune system. Here, we examined the effect of LL-37 on proinflammatory responses induced by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and cytokines in primary human keratinocytes. LL-37 inhibited dsRNA-induced production of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), CCL5/RANTES, CXCL10/IP-10, and CXCL8/IL-8, which was attributable to interaction  between LL-37 and dsRNA, although LL-37 upregulated CXCL8 expression at an earlier time point (8 h). LL-37 inhibited the increase of CXCL10 and CCL5 induced by TNF-α- and/or IFN-γ but enhanced that of CXCL8. LL-37 and Th17 cytokines (IL-17 and IL-22) synergistically upregulated the expression of CXCL8 and IL-6. LL-37 showed the effects above at a high concentration (25 μg/ml, 5.6 μM). We also examined effects of a peptide with a scrambled LL-37 sequence, which has been frequently used as a negative control, and those of another peptide with the reversed LL-37 sequence, activities of which have not been well investigated. Interestingly, the reversed LL-37 had effects similar to LL-37 but the scrambled  LL-37 did not. The modulation by LL-37 of the keratinocyte proinflammatory responses induced by cytokine milieus and dsRNA suggests novel roles for LL-37 in skin inflammation such as the promotion of IL17/IL-22/IL-6-associated psoriasis and suppression of TSLP-associated atopic dermatitis.

Interleukin-17/T-helper 17 cells in an atopic dermatitis mouse model aggravate orthodontic root resorption in dental pulp.  Shimizu M(1), Yamaguchi M, Fujita S, Utsunomiya T, Yamamoto H, Kasai K.  Author information:  (1)Department of Orthodontics, Nihon University School of Dentistry at Matsudo, Chiba, Japan.  Interleukin (IL)-17 is an important mediator of orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption (OIIRR). However, its role in the dental pulp (DP) has not been studied. The aim of this study was to investigate, using an atopic dermatitis (AD) model, how IL-17 contributes to OIIRR in DP. Atopic dermatitis is the most common IL-17-associated allergic disease. Atopic dermatitis model mice (AD group) and wild-type mice (control group) were subjected to an excessive orthodontic force. The localization of T-helper (Th)17 cells, IL-17, IL-6, and keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC; an IL-8-related protein in rodents) were determined in DP. In addition, CD4+ T cells, including IL-17 production cells, were obtained from patients with AD and from healthy donors, and the effects of IL-17 on the production of IL-6 and IL-8 were investigated using a co-culture of  CD4+ T cells with human dental pulp (hDP) cells stimulated with substance P (SP). Immunoreactivity for Th17 cells, IL-17, IL-6, and KC was increased in DP tissue subjected to orthodontic force in the AD group compared with DP tissue subjected  to orthodontic force in the control group. The cells obtained from the AD patients displayed increased IL-6 and IL-8 production. These results suggest that IL-17 may aggravate OIIRR in DP.  © 2013 Eur J Oral Sci.

Hou M(1), Sun R, Hupe M, Kim PL, Park K, Crumrine D, Lin TK, Santiago JL, Mauro TM, Elias PM, Man MQ.  Author information:  (1)Dermatology Service, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.  The beneficial effects of certain herbal medicines on cutaneous function have been appreciated for centuries. Among these agents, chrysanthemum extract, apigenin, has been used for skin care, particularly in China, for millennia. However, the underlying mechanisms by which apigenin benefits the skin are not known. In this study, we first determined whether topical apigenin positively influences permeability barrier homoeostasis, and then the basis thereof. Hairless mice were treated topically with either 0.1% apigenin or vehicle alone twice daily for 9 days. At the end of the treatments, permeability barrier function was assessed with either an electrolytic water analyzer or a Tewameter.  Our results show that topical apigenin significantly enhanced permeability barrier homoeostasis after tape stripping, although basal permeability barrier function remained unchanged. Improved barrier function correlated with enhanced filaggrin expression and lamellar body production, which was paralleled by elevated mRNA levels for the epidermal ABCA12. The mRNA levels for key lipid synthetic enzymes also were upregulated by apigenin. Finally, both cathelicidin-related peptide and mouse beta-defensin 3 immunostaining were increased by apigenin. We conclude that topical apigenin improves epidermal permeability barrier function by stimulating epidermal differentiation, lipid synthesis and secretion, as well as cutaneous antimicrobial peptide production. Apigenin could be useful for the prevention and treatment of skin disorders characterized by permeability barrier dysfunction, associated with reduced filaggrin levels and impaired antimicrobial defenses, such as atopic dermatitis.  © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Protease-activated receptor-2 induces proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine gene expression in canine keratinocytes.  Maeda S(1), Maeda S, Ohno K, Kaji N, Hori M, Fujino Y, Tsujimoto H.  Author information:  (1)Department of Veterinary Internal Medicine, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.  Although the molecular basis of the allergenicity remains to be fully elucidated, the ability of allergens to elicit allergic responses is at least partly attributed to their proteolytic activity. Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) is a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by site-specific proteolysis by serine proteases and is known to mediate inflammatory processes in various tissues. In this study, we investigated the effects of trypsin, a major serine protease, and a human PAR-2 agonist peptide (SLIGKV-NH2) on proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine gene expression in the canine keratinocyte cell line CPEK. The expression of PAR-2 mRNA and protein in CPEK cells was detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The localization of PAR-2 in CPEK was examined by immunofluorescence. The mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were quantified by real-time RT-PCR. The free intracellular Ca(2+) concentration was measured using the Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent dye. CPEK cells constitutively expressed PAR-2 mRNA and protein. Stimulation of CPEK cells with trypsin induced significant upregulation of the mRNA expression levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α, P<0.05), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating  factor (GM-CSF, P<0.01), thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17, P<0.01), and interleukin 8 (IL-8/CXCL8, P<0.01). Similarly, the PAR-2 agonist peptide increased the mRNA expression levels of TNF-α (P<0.05), GM-CSF (P<0.05),  TARC/CCL17 (P<0.05), and IL-8/CXCL8 (P<0.05) in CPEK cells. Both trypsin and the  PAR-2 agonist peptide increased the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and PAR-2  internalization. These results suggest that PAR-2 activation can augment inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression in canine keratinocytes, and it may initiate allergic inflammation through the proteolytic activity of allergens  in canine atopic dermatitis.

Protease activity enhances production of thymic stromal lymphopoietin and basophil accumulation in flaky tail mice.  Moniaga CS(1), Jeong SK, Egawa G, Nakajima S, Hara-Chikuma M, Jeon JE, Lee SH, Hibino T, Miyachi Y, Kabashima K.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.  Epidermal barrier abnormality due to filaggrin deficiency is an important predisposing factor in the development of atopic dermatitis (AD). In addition, the expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in keratinocytes (KCs), induced by barrier disruption, can promote type 2 helper T-cell polarization. Protease activity, including protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), is also known to be involved in epidermal barrier function in AD. However, to our knowledge, the relationship between protease activity and filaggrin deficiency from the perspective of AD has not been elucidated. Flaky tail (Flg(ft)) mice, known to have a mutation in the filaggrin gene, were used to assess the role of protease in KCs in the steady state and the mite-induced AD-like skin inflammation model.  In the steady state, the expression and activity levels of endogenous proteases,  kallikreins 5, 7, and 14, in the skin and TSLP were higher in Flg(ft) than in control mice. In addition, activation of PAR-2 by its agonist induced the production of TSLP in KCs of Flg(ft) mice, which was abrogated by a newly developed PAR-2 antagonist. Application of the PAR-2 antagonist improved symptoms and basophil accumulation in Flg(ft) mice treated with mite extracts. These results suggest that possibly through the PAR-2 activation in KCs, filaggrin deficiency induces TSLP production and basophil accumulation, which play important roles in the establishment of AD.

Epidermal nerve fibers modulate keratinocyte growth via neuropeptide signaling in an innervated skin model.  Roggenkamp D(1), Köpnick S, Stäb F, Wenck H, Schmelz M, Neufang G.  Author information:  (1)Research and Development, Beiersdorf AG, Hamburg, Germany.  Comment in     J Invest Dermatol. 2013 Jun;133(6):1465-7.  Atopic eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by cutaneous nerve fiber sprouting and epidermal hyperplasia, pointing to an involvement of the peripheral nervous system in cutaneous homeostasis. However, the interaction  of sensory neurons and skin cells is poorly understood. Using an innervated skin  model, we investigated the influence of sensory neurons on epidermal morphogenesis. Neurons induced the proliferation of keratinocytes, resulting in an increase in the epidermal thickness. Inhibition of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), but not substance P (SP) signaling, reversed this effect. Human CGRP enhanced keratinocyte proliferation and epidermal thickness in skin models,  demonstrating a key role of CGRP in modulating epidermal morphogenesis, whereas SP had only a moderate effect. Innervated skin models composed of atopic skin cells showed increased neurite outgrowth, accompanied by elevated CGRP release. As atopic keratinocytes were sensitized to CGRP owing to higher expression levels of the CGRP receptor components, receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) and receptor component protein (RCP), atopic innervated skin models displayed a thicker epidermis than did healthy controls. We conclude that neural CGRP controls local keratinocyte growth. Our results show that the crosstalk of the cutaneous peripheral nervous system and skin cells significantly influences epidermal morphogenesis and homeostasis in healthy and atopic skin.

Filaggrin-dependent secretion of sphingomyelinase protects against staphylococcal α-toxin-induced keratinocyte death.  Brauweiler AM(1), Bin L, Kim BE, Oyoshi MK, Geha RS, Goleva E, Leung DY.  Author information:  (1)Division of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, National Jewish Health, Denver,  Colo, USA.  BACKGROUND: The skin of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) has defects in keratinocyte differentiation, particularly in expression of the epidermal barrier protein filaggrin. AD skin lesions are often exacerbated by Staphylococcus aureus-mediated secretion of the virulence factor α-toxin. It is unknown whether  lack of keratinocyte differentiation predisposes to enhanced lethality from staphylococcal toxins. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether keratinocyte differentiation and filaggrin expression protect against cell death induced by staphylococcal α-toxin. METHODS: Filaggrin-deficient primary keratinocytes were generated through small interfering RNA gene knockdown. RNA expression was determined by using real-time  PCR. Cell death was determined by using the lactate dehydrogenase assay. Keratinocyte cell survival in filaggrin-deficient (ft/ft) mouse skin biopsies was determined based on Keratin 5 staining. α-Toxin heptamer formation and acid sphingomyelinase expression were determined by means of immunoblotting. RESULTS: We found that filaggrin expression, occurring as the result of keratinocyte differentiation, significantly inhibits staphylococcal α-toxin-mediated pathogenicity. Furthermore, filaggrin plays a crucial role in protecting cells by mediating the secretion of sphingomyelinase, an enzyme that reduces the number of α-toxin binding sites on the keratinocyte surface. Finally, we determined that sphingomyelinase enzymatic activity directly prevents α-toxin  binding and protects keratinocytes against α-toxin-induced cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The current study introduces the novel concept that S aureus α-toxin preferentially targets and destroys filaggrin-deficient keratinocytes. It also provides a mechanism to explain the increased propensity for S aureus-mediated exacerbation of AD skin disease.  Copyright © 2012 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Activation of epidermal toll-like receptor 2 enhances tight junction function: implications for atopic dermatitis and skin barrier repair.  Kuo IH(1), Carpenter-Mendini A, Yoshida T, McGirt LY, Ivanov AI, Barnes KC, Gallo RL, Borkowski AW, Yamasaki K, Leung DY, Georas SN, De Benedetto A, Beck LA.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester,  NY, USA.  Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by epidermal tight junction (TJ) defects  and a propensity for Staphylococcus aureus skin infections. S. aureus is sensed by many pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). We  hypothesized that an effective innate immune response will include skin barrier repair, and that this response is impaired in AD subjects. S. aureus-derived peptidoglycan (PGN) and synthetic TLR2 agonists enhanced TJ barrier and increased expression of TJ proteins, claudin-1 (CLDN1), claudin-23 (CLDN23), occludin, and  Zonulae occludens 1 (ZO-1) in primary human keratinocytes. A TLR2 agonist enhanced skin barrier recovery in human epidermis wounded by tape stripping. Tlr2(-/-) mice had a delayed and incomplete barrier recovery following tape stripping. AD subjects had reduced epidermal TLR2 expression as compared with nonatopic subjects, which inversely correlated (r=-0.654, P=0.0004) with transepidermal water loss (TEWL). These observations indicate that TLR2 activation enhances skin barrier in murine and human skin and is an important part of a wound repair response.

IL-4 up-regulates epidermal chemotactic, angiogenic, and pro-inflammatory genes and down-regulates antimicrobial genes in vivo and in vitro: relevant in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis.  Bao L(1), Shi VY, Chan LS.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.  Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease. Although the pathogenesis of AD is not fully understood, we and others have shown that IL-4 plays a key role. In this study we aimed to identify keratinocyte genes regulated by IL-4 that may play important roles in the pathophysiology of AD. HaCat cells were treated with IL-4 at various concentrations for 24h, and PCR gene array on inflammation/autoimmunity was performed three times for analysis of differential gene expression. Of all the 370 genes examined, 32 and 53 genes are  up- and down-regulated, respectively. Specifically related to AD, chemokines CCL3L1, CCL8, CCL24, CCL25, CCL26, CXCL6 and CXCL16 are up-regulated by IL-4. Pro-inflammatory factors, such as IL-19, IL-20, IL-1α, IL-12Rβ2, IL-25, IL-31RA,  OSMR and nitric oxide synthase 2, are also up-regulated. In addition, IL-4 up-regulates VEGFA, a pro-angiogenic factor. In contrast, antimicrobial peptides  (AMPs) or factors involved in APM production, such as IFN-κ, S100s, Toll-like receptors, and several chemokines are down-regulated. Similarly IL-4 also down-regulates TNF-α, lymphotoxin-β, an IgE suppressor, TNFSF18, a T-cells function regulator, and the glucocorticoid receptor. On the in vivo level, real-time RT-PCR on the selected genes confirmed that IL-4 up-regulates chemokines, proinflammatory cytokines while it suppresses AMP production related  genes in the skin obtained from IL-4 Tg mice. Detailed examination of these genes will delineate their specific roles in chemotaxis, inflammation, angiogenesis and AMP production, all of which may contribute to the development and progression of AD.

Author information:  (1)DE-MTA Lendület Cellular Physiology Research Group, Department of Physiology,  University of Debrecen, Medical and Health Science Center, Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Nagyerdei krt. 98, H-4032, Debrecen, Hungary.  During embryonic development, the skin, the largest organ of the human body, and  nervous system are both derived from the neuroectoderm. Consequently, several key factors and mechanisms that influence and control central or peripheral nervous system activities are also present and hence involved in various regulatory mechanisms of the skin. Apparently, this is the case for the ion and non-ion selective channels as well. Therefore, in this review, we shall focus on delineating the regulatory roles of the channels in skin physiology and pathophysiology. First, we introduce key cutaneous functions and major characteristics of the channels in question. Then, we systematically detail the involvement of a multitude of channels in such skin processes (e.g. skin barrier  formation, maintenance, and repair, immune mechanisms, exocrine secretion) which  are mostly defined by cutaneous non-neuronal cell populations. Finally, we close  by summarizing data suggesting that selected channels are also involved in skin diseases such as e.g. atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, non-melanoma cancers and malignant melanoma, genetic and autoimmune diseases, etc., as well as in skin ageing.

The Th2 cytokine, interleukin-4, abrogates the cohesion of normal stratum corneum in mice: implications for pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis.  Hatano Y(1), Adachi Y, Elias PM, Crumrine D, Sakai T, Kurahashi R, Katagiri K, Fujiwara S.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Yufu-shi, Oita, Japan. hatano@oita-u.ac.jp  There is mounting evidence that Th2 cytokines adversely affect skin barrier functions and contribute to the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD). AD is also characterized by abnormal cohesion in the stratum corneum (SC). However, the contribution of Th2 cytokines to this abnormality remains unknown. This study examined the effects of IL-4, a prototypic Th2 cytokine, on the cohesion of the SC. Structural and physiological assessments revealed that repeated intradermal injections of IL-4 compromised the cohesion of the SC of normal hairless mice. Two potential mechanisms were explored to account for the altered cohesion. First, IL-4 decreased the amount of corneodesmosomes and down-regulated the expression of desmoglein 1, but not of corneodesmosin (CDSN) or loricrin expression, in murine skin and in cultured human keratinocytes (KC). IL-4 did not affect the skin surface pH, and in situ zymography revealed no net change in total serine protease activity in the IL-4-treated SC. Yet, IL-4 enhanced expression of kallikrein (KLK)7, while simultaneously down-regulating KLK5 and KLK14. Finally, IL-4 did not alter the expression of the lympho-epithelial Kazal-type inhibitor (LEKTI) in KC. This study suggests that IL-4 abrogates the cohesion of SC primarily by reducing epidermal differentiation.  © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.  DOI: 10.1111/exd.12047 	23173934

Gschwandtner M(1), Mildner M, Mlitz V, Gruber F, Eckhart L, Werfel T, Gutzmer R,  Elias PM, Tschachler E.  Author information:  (1)Research Division of Biology and Pathobiology of the Skin, Department of Dermatology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.  BACKGROUND: Defects in keratinocyte differentiation and skin barrier are important features of inflammatory skin diseases like atopic dermatitis. Mast cells and their main mediator histamine are abundant in inflamed skin and thus may contribute to disease pathogenesis. METHODS: Human primary keratinocytes were cultured under differentiation-promoting conditions in the presence and absence of histamine, histamine receptor agonists and antagonists. The expression of differentiation-associated genes and epidermal junction proteins was quantified by real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence labeling. The barrier function of human skin models was tested by the application of biotin as tracer molecule. RESULTS: The addition of histamine to human keratinocyte cultures and organotypic skin models reduced the expression of the differentiation-associated proteins keratin 1/10, filaggrin, and loricrin by 80-95%. Moreover, the addition of histamine to skin models resulted in the loss of the granular layer and thinning  of the epidermis and stratum corneum by 50%. The histamine receptor H1R agonist,  2-pyridylethylamine, suppressed keratinocyte differentiation to the same extent as did histamine. Correspondingly, cetirizine, an antagonist of H1R, virtually abrogated the effect of histamine. The expression of tight junction proteins zona occludens-1, occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-4, as well as that of desmosomal junction proteins corneodesmosin and desmoglein-1, was down-regulated by histamine. The tracer molecule biotin readily penetrated the tight junction barrier of skin cultures grown in the presence of histamine, while their diffusion was completely blocked in nontreated controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a new mechanism by which mast cell activation and histamine release contribute to skin barrier defects in inflammatory skin diseases.  © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Transcription of canine toll-like receptor 2, β-defensin 1 and β-defensin 103 in  infected atopic skin, non-infected atopic skin, healthy skin and the CPEK cell line.  Mullin J(1), Carter S, Williams N, McEwan N, Nuttall T.  Author information:  (1)Department of Clinical Infection, Microbiology and Immunology, The University  of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.  Dogs and humans with atopic dermatitis (AD) have a high prevalence of recurrent staphylococcal pyoderma. β-Defensins (BDs) and toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important in innate immunity against bacterial skin infections, and decreased BD  and TLR2 expression has been associated with human AD. However, findings from recent studies of BD expression in human and canine AD have been variable and contradictory. The aim of this study was to further our understanding of the role of antimicrobial proteins in canine AD by quantifying mRNA for canine (c) BD1, cBD103 and TLR2 in healthy skin (n=17 dogs), matched samples of atopic skin with  and without active infection by Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (n=13 dogs), and  the canine keratinocyte cell line CPEK cultured with 5 ng/ml tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and 10 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS). mRNA for cBD1, CB103 and TLR2 were detected in all samples. TNFα significantly increased transcription of cBD1, cBD103 and TLR2 in the CPEK cells. mRNA for cBD103 was also significantly increased after stimulation with LPS. There were no significant differences in mRNA levels for cBD1, cBD103 or TLR2 in healthy, non-infected atopic or infected atopic skin. Canine AD did not appear to be associated with altered expression of cBD1, cBD103 and TLR2 in these dogs. Other studies have reported both increased and decreased expression of these antimicrobial peptides  in canine AD and pyoderma, and therefore further investigation of the clinical significance of these mediators is required.

Illicium verum extract inhibits TNF-α- and IFN-γ-induced expression of chemokines and cytokines in human keratinocytes.  Sung YY(1), Kim YS, Kim HK.  Author information:  (1)Department of Biochemistry, College of Natural Sciences, Chungnam National University, Daejeon 305-764, Republic of Korea.  ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Illicium verum Hook. f. (star anise) has been used in traditional medicine for treatment of skin inflammation, rheumatism, asthma, and bronchitis. This study investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of  Illicium verum extract (IVE) in the human keratinocyte HaCaT cell line. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the effectiveness of IVE in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)/interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-induced human keratinocytes. To measure the effects of IVE on chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in HaCaT cells, we used the following methods: cell viability assay, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting, and luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: IVE inhibited the expression of TNF-α/IFN-γ-induced mRNA and protein expression of thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17), macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1β. Furthermore, IVE decreased TNF-α/IFN-γ-induced mRNA expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). IVE inhibited nuclear factor (NF)-κB translocation  into the nucleus, as well as phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα. IVE inhibited TNF-α/IFN-γ-induced NF-κB and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 activation in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, IVE significantly inhibited activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Akt. Furthermore, IVE contained 2.14% trans-anethole and possessed significant anti-inflammatory activities. CONCLUSIONS: IVE exerts anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing the expression of TNF-α/IFN-γ-induced chemokines, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and adhesion molecules via blockade of NF-κB, STAT1, MAPK, and Akt activation, suggesting that IVE may be a useful therapeutic candidate for inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis.

Periostin contributes to the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis by inducing TSLP production from keratinocytes.  Shiraishi H(1), Masuoka M, Ohta S, Suzuki S, Arima K, Taniguchi K, Aoki S, Toda S, Yoshimoto T, Inagaki N, Conway SJ, Narisawa Y, Izuhara K.  Author information:  (1)Division of Medical Biochemistry, Department of Biomolecular Sciences, Saga Medical School, Japan.  BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease where Th2-type immune responses are dominant. Keratinocytes persistently secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, amplifying Th2-type responses in AD. We have recently reported that periostin, an extracellular matrix protein induced by Th2 cytokines, plays a critical role in AD. In the present study, we have further investigated the characteristics of our allergen-induced AD model mice and the role of periostin in the pathogenesis of AD. METHODS: The ears of C57BL/6 mice, BALB/c mice, and Rag-2-/- γ(c)-/- mice (BALB/c background) were epicutaneously sensitized repeatedly with HDM. Mice were analyzed after the final sensitization. To examine the direct role of periostin,  we reconstituted skin in vitro by coculture of keratinocytes with wild-type or periostin-deficient fibroblasts. RESULTS: Epicutaneous sensitization with HDM induced AD-like phenotypes and accumulation of periostin in dermis in C57BL/6 mice but not in Rag-2-/- γ(c)-/- mice. In vitro organotypic coculture systems revealed that periostin promoted survival and proliferation of keratinocytes and directly induced production of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that periostin exacerbates the pathogenesis of AD through TSLP production from keratinocytes.  DOI: 10.2332/allergolint.10-OA-0297 	22918211

Bin L(1), Kim BE, Brauweiler A, Goleva E, Streib J, Ji Y, Schlievert PM, Leung DY.  Author information:  (1)Department of Pediatrics, National Jewish Health, Denver, CO 80206, USA.  BACKGROUND: Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) with a history of eczema herpeticum have increased staphylococcal colonization and infections. However, whether Staphylococcus aureus alters the outcome of skin viral infection has not  been determined. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether S aureus toxins modulated host response to herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and vaccinia virus (VV) infections in normal human keratinocytes (NHKs) and in murine infection models. METHODS: NHKs were treated with S aureus toxins before incubation of viruses. BALB/c mice were inoculated with S aureus 2 days before VV scarification. Viral loads of HSV-1 and VV were evaluated by using real-time PCR, a viral plaque-forming assay, and immunofluorescence staining. Small interfering RNA duplexes were used to knockdown the gene expression of the cellular receptor of α-toxin, a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10). ADAM10 protein and α-toxin heptamers were detected by using Western blot assays. RESULTS: We demonstrate that sublytic staphylococcal α-toxin increases viral loads of HSV-1 and VV in NHKs. Furthermore, we demonstrate in vivo that the VV load is significantly greater (P < .05) in murine skin inoculated with an α-toxin-producing S aureus strain compared with murine skin inoculated with the isogenic α-toxin-deleted strain. The viral enhancing effect of α-toxin is mediated by ADAM10 and is associated with its pore-forming property. Moreover, we demonstrate that α-toxin promotes viral entry in NHKs. CONCLUSION: The current study introduces the novel concept that staphylococcal α-toxin promotes viral skin infection and provides a mechanism by which S aureus  infection might predispose the host toward disseminated viral infections.

Interleukin-33 modulates the expression of human β-defensin 2 in human primary keratinocytes and may influence the susceptibility to bacterial superinfection in acute atopic dermatitis.  Alase A(1), Seltmann J, Werfel T, Wittmann M.  Author information:  (1)Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine, Division of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Disease, LMBRU, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK. a.a.alase@leeds.ac.uk  BACKGROUND: Interleukin (IL)-33 is a member of the IL-1 family and has been implicated in Th2-driven allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and asthma. The principal Th2 cytokine IL-4, found highly expressed in acute allergic eczema, is known to downregulate human β-defensin 2 (hBD2) expression in human keratinocytes and this is associated with superinfection in patients with AD. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of IL-33 on the expression of hBD2 in human keratinocytes. METHODS: hBD2 production by stimulated keratinocytes was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Our results showed that serum is a very potent inducer of hBD2 and 2·5%  human serum was much more potent in inducing hBD2 than 20 ng mL(-1) of tumour necrosis factor-α. Interestingly, serum from patients with AD showed an impaired  ability to induce hBD2 in normal keratinocytes. IL-33 significantly downregulated serum-induced hBD2. The downregulatory capacity of IL-33 was found to be 1·5- to  2-fold weaker compared with IL-4. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that IL-33 can significantly contribute to the decreased expression of hBD2 in acute eczematous reaction clinically characterized by spongiosis and oozing - thus indicative for contact of the epidermis with serum components.  © 2012 The Authors.

Reduced expression of epidermal growth factor receptor, E-cadherin, and occludin  in the skin of flaky tail mice is due to filaggrin and loricrin deficiencies.  Nakai K(1), Yoneda K, Hosokawa Y, Moriue T, Presland RB, Fallon PG, Kabashima K,  Kosaka H, Kubota Y.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Japan. kozo@kms.ac.jp  Disruption of skin barrier function leads to increases in the percutaneous transfer of allergens and the incidence of atopic dermatitis. Flaky tail (Flg(ft)) mice have been used as a model of atopic dermatitis with skin barrier dysfunction. Although Flg(ft) mice are known to have filaggrin mutation, the mechanism responsible for the skin barrier dysfunction that they display needs to be determined, especially for the roles of epidermal adhesion and junction proteins. Herein, we report the decreased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), E-cadherin, occludin, and SIRT1 in the skin of Flg(ft) mice, compared with those in C57BL/6J mice. Administration of N-acetyl-L-cysteine, an antioxidant, in the drinking water improved these protein expressions in the skin of Flg(ft) mice. Notably, we discovered that loricrin expression was suppressed in Flg(ft) mice. In vitro experiments showed that filaggrin small interfering RNA, loricrin small interfering RNA, or SIRT1 inhibitor sirtinol suppressed the expression levels of EGFR, E-cadherin, and occludin in a human immortalized keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT cells). Our findings suggest that the observed reductions in EGFR, E-cadherin, and occludin expression were due to filaggrin deficiency accompanied with subsequent loricrin deficiency and disruption of the  SIRT1 pathway in the skin of Flg(ft) mice.

The antagonism of histamine H1 and H4 receptors ameliorates chronic allergic dermatitis via anti-pruritic and anti-inflammatory effects in NC/Nga mice.  Ohsawa Y(1), Hirasawa N.  Author information:  (1)Laboratory of Pharmacotherapy of Life-Style Related Diseases, Graduate School  of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan. yuusuke_oosawa@pharm.kissei.co.jp  BACKGROUND: Although histamine H1 receptor (H1R) antagonists are commonly used to treat atopic dermatitis, the treatment is not always effective. The histamine H4  receptor (H4R) was recently described as important to the pruritus in dermatitis. Here, we investigated whether the combination of a H1R antagonist plus a H4R antagonist attenuates chronic dermatitis in NC/Nga mice. METHODS: Chronic dermatitis was developed by repeated challenges with picryl chloride on the dorsal back and ear lobes. The therapeutic effects of the H1R antagonist olopatadine and H4R antagonist JNJ7777120 on scratching and the severity of dermatitis were evaluated. In addition, the mechanisms responsible for the anti-allergic effects of H1R and/or H4R antagonism were examined using bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) and keratinocytes. RESULTS: JNJ7777120 attenuated scratching behavior after a single administration  and improved dermatitis, as assessed with clinical scores, pathology, and cytokine levels in skin lesions when administered repeatedly. These effects were  augmented by combined treatment with olopatadine, having a similar therapeutic efficacy to prednisolone. JNJ7777120 inhibited dose-dependently the production of thymus and activation-regulated chemokine/CCL17 and macrophage-derived chemokine/CCL22 from antigen-stimulated BMMC. In addition, olopatadine reversed the histamine-induced reduction of semaphorin 3A mRNA in keratinocytes. CONCLUSION: Combined treatment with H1R and H4R antagonists may have a significant therapeutic effect on chronic dermatitis through the synergistic inhibition of pruritus and skin inflammation.  © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Masuoka M(1), Shiraishi H, Ohta S, Suzuki S, Arima K, Aoki S, Toda S, Inagaki N,  Kurihara Y, Hayashida S, Takeuchi S, Koike K, Ono J, Noshiro H, Furue M, Conway SJ, Narisawa Y, Izuhara K.  Author information:  (1)Division of Medical Biochemistry, Department of Biomolecular Sciences, Saga Medical School, Saga, Japan.  Allergic inflammation triggered by exposure of an allergen frequently leads to the onset of chronic inflammatory diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and bronchial asthma. The mechanisms underlying chronicity in allergic inflammation remain unresolved. Periostin, a recently characterized matricellular protein, interacts with several cell surface integrin molecules, providing signals for tissue development and remodeling. Here we show that periostin is a critical mediator for the amplification and persistence of allergic inflammation using a mouse model of skin inflammation. Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 stimulated fibroblasts to produce periostin, which interacted with αv integrin, a functional periostin receptor on keratinocytes, inducing production of proinflammatory cytokines, which consequently accelerated Th2-type immune responses. Accordingly, inhibition of periostin or αv integrin prevented the development or progression of allergen-induced skin inflammation. Thus, periostin sets up a vicious circle that links Th2-type immune responses to keratinocyte activation and plays a critical role in the amplification and chronicity of allergic skin inflammation.

OX40 ligand and OX40 are increased in atopic dermatitis lesions but do not correlate with clinical severity.  Ilves T(1), Harvima IT.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Eastern Finland and Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland. tiina.ilves@kuh.fi  BACKGROUND: The interaction between the OX40 ligand (OX40L) and OX40 has been suggested to have pathogenetic significance in atopic dermatitis (AD). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression and relevance of OX40L and OX40 in AD skin. METHODS: OX40L and OX40 were stained immunohistochemically on the cryosections of the lesional and non-lesional skin of 17 subjects with moderate-to-severe AD and  of 10 patients with psoriasis vulgaris. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulated keratinocytes and cell membrane preparations from PMA-stimulated keratinocytes or LAD-2 mast cells were incubated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the presence or absence of blocking monoclonal antibodies to OX40L, CD30L or ICAM-1. RESULTS: We show for the first time that the staining intensity of OX40L and the  number of OX40(+) cells are significantly greater in the lesional dermis than in  the healthy-looking dermis in AD (P < 0.001 in both comparisons) and also in psoriasis (P = 0.01 and P < 0.001 respectively), but neither molecule correlate significantly with the clinical severity of AD. Living keratinocytes and cell membranes from LAD-2 mast cells and keratinocytes increased the PBMC proliferation response. Anti-OX40L antibody inhibited, in a similar fashion as anti-ICAM-1 and anti-CD30L, PBMC proliferation induced by LAD-2 membranes, but stimulated that induced by keratinocytes. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence for the involvement of OX40 and OX40L in the pathogenesis of AD though they are not specific to AD and in vitro results suggest complex interaction.  © 2012 The Authors.

Epidermal ADAM17 maintains the skin barrier by regulating EGFR ligand-dependent terminal keratinocyte differentiation.  Franzke CW(1), Cobzaru C, Triantafyllopoulou A, Löffek S, Horiuchi K, Threadgill  DW, Kurz T, van Rooijen N, Bruckner-Tuderman L, Blobel CP.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University Freiburg Medical Center, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany. claus-werner.franzke@uniklinik-freiburg.de  Erratum in     J Exp Med. 2012 Dec 17;209(13):2517.  ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17) is ubiquitously expressed and cleaves membrane proteins, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands, l-selectin, and TNF, from the cell surface, thus regulating responses to tissue injury and inflammation. However, little is currently known about its role in skin homeostasis. We show that mice lacking ADAM17 in keratinocytes (A17(ΔKC)) have a normal epidermal barrier and skin architecture at birth but develop pronounced defects in epidermal barrier integrity soon after birth and develop chronic dermatitis as adults. The dysregulated expression of epidermal differentiation proteins becomes evident 2 d after birth, followed by reduced transglutaminase (TGM) activity, transepidermal water loss, up-regulation of the  proinflammatory cytokine IL-36α, and inflammatory immune cell infiltration. Activation of the EGFR was strongly reduced in A17(ΔKC) skin, and topical treatment of A17(ΔKC) mice with recombinant TGF-α significantly improved TGM activity and decreased skin inflammation. Finally, we show that mice lacking the  EGFR in keratinocytes (Egfr(ΔKC)) closely resembled A17(ΔKC) mice. Collectively,  these results identify a previously unappreciated critical role of the ADAM17-EGFR signaling axis in maintaining the homeostasis of the postnatal epidermal barrier and suggest that this pathway could represent a good target for treatment of epidermal barrier defects.

Author information:  (1)Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.  Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases in industrialized countries. To identify candidate genes involved in the pathogenesis of AD, we previously undertook a genome-wide approach using DNA microarrays. A transcript encoding the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was found to be among the down-regulated transcripts in AD skin. Here, we further investigated the expression pattern of two EGFR family members (EGFR and ErbB2) in AD skin on a protein level. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of EGFR and ErbB2 showed decreased expression of EGFR and ErbB2 proteins in AD lesional skin  as compared to skin from healthy individuals. Interestingly, we found that EGFR and ErbB2 were reciprocally expressed in an in vitro model of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, paralleling the expression patterns found in epidermis of healthy skin. The highest levels of EGFR transcripts were found in proliferating cells, while ErbB2 was found in differentiated cells. We show that  blocking EGFR activity combined with co-stimulation of the Th2-cytokine IL4 in keratinocytes leads to induction of the inflammatory chemokine CCL26/eotaxin-3 in vitro. Accordingly, increased CCL26 transcriptional levels were observed in AD lesional skin. Taken together, suppression of EGFR may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD via the regulation of inflammatory chemokines.  DOI: 10.1007/s00403-012-1242-4 	22552355

Ciclosporin modulates the responses of canine progenitor epidermal keratinocytes  (CPEK) to toll-like receptor agonists.  Hendricks A(1), Elson-Riggins JG, Riddle AL, House AK, Varjonen K, Bond R.  Author information:  (1)Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College, Hawkshead Lane, North Mymms, Hatfield, Herts AL9 7TA, UK. ahendricks@rvc.ac.uk  Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 dependent pathways have an important role in the antimicrobial defense of human keratinocytes, and various factors and compounds have been shown to affect those pathways. Investigating Toll-like receptor function in canine keratinocytes and the potential for their modulation is of similar relevance in dogs due to the frequency of staphylococcal skin infections  in this species, particularly in the context of canine atopic dermatitis. This pilot study hypothesized that ciclosporin would have a modulatory effect on the cytokine and TLR mRNA expression of canine progenitor epidermal keratinocytes in  response to TLR2 agonists. No detectable up-regulation of TLR2, TLR4, IL-8 and TNF-α mRNA was detected following exposure to FSL-1, Pam3CSK4 and staphylococcal  peptidoglycan (PGN). Ciclosporin alone did not alter the expression levels of these transcripts but in the presence of ciclosporin, TNF-α mRNA expression was upregulated in response to all three agonists and both TNF-α and IL-8 transcript  abundance was increased in response to Pam3CSK4. The enhanced responsiveness of canine keratinocytes to TLR2 agonists in response to ciclosporin may imply that administration of this drug might enhance the innate immune barrier of skin.

Long TSLP transcript expression and release of TSLP induced by TLR ligands and cytokines in human keratinocytes.  Xie Y(1), Takai T, Chen X, Okumura K, Ogawa H.  Author information:  (1)Atopy (Allergy) Research Center, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo 113-8421, Japan.  BACKGROUND: Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), highly expressed in keratinocytes in atopic dermatitis patients and bronchial epithelial cells in asthma patients, plays a key role in allergic diseases. Two forms of TSLP mRNA (long and short) have been reported. OBJECTIVE: We compared the expression of the long-form and total TSLP transcripts in primary human keratinocytes. METHODS: Primary human keratinocytes were stimulated with Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, cytokines, and vitamin D receptor agonists. Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. The amount of TSLP released was measured  by ELISA. RESULTS: PolyI:C (TLR3 ligand), FSL-1 (TLR2-TLR6 ligand) and flagellin (TLR5 ligand) upregulated long-form TSLP expression, which predominantly contributed to upregulation of total TSLP expression. A glucocorticoid or an endosomal acidification inhibitor inhibited the polyI:C-dependent upregulation of total TSLP and the decrease of the total TSLP was due to the decrease of the long-form. An atopic cytokine milieu (TNF-α+IL-4+IL-13) or TNF-α alone also upregulated the  long-form. These stimuli also induced the release of TSLP. In contrast, a high concentration of calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3), the active form of vitamin D(3)) or its analog MC903 upregulated total TSLP significantly but not the long-form, and did not induce the release of TSLP. CONCLUSION: TLR ligands or cytokines predominantly upregulate the gene expression of the long TSLP form, which contributes to the TSLP protein production, in primary human keratinocytes. Specific measurement of the long-form rather than total TSLP should be useful for accurate detection of functional human TSLP gene  expression.

The human epidermal differentiation complex: cornified envelope precursors, S100  proteins and the 'fused genes' family.  Kypriotou M(1), Huber M, Hohl D.  Author information:  (1)Laboratory of Cutaneous Biology, Service of Dermatology and Venereology, Beaumont Hospital CHUV, Lausanne, Switzerland.    The skin is essential for survival and protects our body against biological attacks, physical stress, chemical injury, water loss, ultraviolet radiation and  immunological impairment. The epidermal barrier constitutes the primordial frontline of this defense established during terminal differentiation. During this complex process proliferating basal keratinocytes become suprabasally mitotically inactive and move through four epidermal layers (basal, spinous, granular and layer, stratum corneum) constantly adapting to the needs of the respective cell layer. As a result, squamous keratinocytes contain polymerized keratin intermediate filament bundles and a water-retaining matrix surrounded by  the cross-linked cornified cell envelope (CE) with ceramide lipids attached on the outer surface. These cells are concomitantly insulated by intercellular lipid lamellae and hold together by corneodesmosmes. Many proteins essential for epidermal differentiation are encoded by genes clustered on chromosomal human region 1q21. These genes constitute the 'epidermal differentiation complex' (EDC), which is divided on the basis of common gene and protein structures, in three gene families: (i) CE precursors, (ii) S100A and (iii) S100 fused genes. EDC protein expression is regulated in a gene and tissue-specific manner by a pool of transcription factors. Among them, Klf4, Grhl3 and Arnt are essential, and their deletion in mice is lethal. The importance of the EDC is further reflected by human diseases: FLG mutations are the strongest risk factor for atopic dermatitis (AD) and for AD-associated asthma, and faulty CE formation caused by TG1 deficiency causes life-threatening lamellar ichthyosis. Here, we review the EDC genes and the progress in this field.  © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.  DOI: 10.1111/j.1600-0625.2012.01472.x 	22507538

Robertson ED(1), Weir L, Romanowska M, Leigh IM, Panteleyev AA.  Author information:  (1)Centre for Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Division of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Dentistry and Nursing, Ninewells Hospital, University of Dundee, UK.  Previously we showed that spatial and developmental modulation of ARNT (HIF1β) expression in mouse epidermis is essential for maintenance of keratinocyte differentiation, proper formation of the barrier and normal desquamation. Here, using lentiviral suppression or induction of ARNT in TERT-immortalized (N-TERT) and HaCaT cells we assessed the nature and mechanisms of ARNT involvement in control of differentiation in human epidermal keratinocytes. ARNT depletion did not affect the levels of basal keratins K5 and K14, but significantly induced expression of several key differentiation markers (an effect abolished by EGF supplementation). Furthermore, ARNT deficiency resulted in the downregulation of  amphiregulin (AREG) - the most highly expressed EGFR ligand in human keratinocytes - whereas upregulation of ARNT showed the opposite. In ARNT-deficient monolayer cultures and 3D epidermal equivalents, the downregulation of AREG was concurrent with a decline of EGFR and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. TSA, a potent suppressor of HDAC activity, abolished the effects of ARNT deficiency, implying a role for HDACs in ARNT-dependent modulation of the AREG-EGFR pathway and downstream epidermal genes. Total HDAC activity was significantly increased in ARNT-depleted cells and decreased with ARNT overexpression. ARNT-dependent shifts in HDAC activity were specifically attributed to significant changes in the levels of HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3 proteins (but not mRNA) in both monolayer and 3D cultures. Collectively, our results suggest that ARNT controls AREG expression and the downstream EGFR-ERK pathway in keratinocytes, at least in part, by modulating HDAC activity. This novel regulatory pathway targeting advanced stages of epidermal differentiation might have important implications for skin pathology such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and cancer.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology and Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA. SteinhoffM@derm.ucsf.edu  Comment on     J Invest Dermatol. 2012 May;132(5):1392-400.  IL-33 is a newly recognized cytokine of the IL-1 cytokine family that has recently been attributed to the epithelial "alarmin" defense system. IL-33 is released by the epithelial cells in various tissues and organs, including keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and immune cells. Recent reports have suggested that IL-33 might be a critical part of the innate immunity, although its precise  role is as yet poorly understood. In several organs, IL-33 appears to drive T helper type 2 (Th2) responses, suggesting roles in allergic and atopic diseases,  as well as in fibrosis. IL-33 exerts its effects by activating the ST2 (suppression of tumorigenicity 2)/IL-1 aR receptor on different types of cells, including mast cells and Th2 cells. The ST2 receptor is either expressed on the cell surface or shed from these cells (soluble ST2, sST2), thereby functioning as a "decoy" receptor. After binding to its receptor, IL-33 activates NF-κB, suggesting that it regulates the outcome of diseases such as atopic dermatitis. On the other hand, several studies have reported on the inhibitory effects of sST2 in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases, suggesting that IL-33/ST2 is a unique cytokine with potential pro- and anti-inflammatory effects.

Decreased serum LL-37 and vitamin D3 levels in atopic dermatitis: relationship between IL-31 and oncostatin M.  Kanda N(1), Hau CS, Tada Y, Sato S, Watanabe S.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, Teikyo University, Tokyo, Japan. nmk@med.teikyo-u.ac.jp  BACKGROUND: Skin lesions with atopic dermatitis (AD) are associated with dysregulated expression of LL-37 and enhanced expression of IL-22, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), IL-25, IL-31, and oncostatin M. Vitamin D3 enhances LL-37 production in keratinocytes. This study aimed to examine the serum levels of LL-37 and vitamin D3 and their regulation of cytokine production in patients with AD. METHODS: Serum levels of LL-37 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 were analyzed by ELISA. The effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or LL-37 on cytokine production in T cells or keratinocytes were analyzed by ELISA and real-time PCR. RESULTS: Serum levels of LL-37 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 were decreased in patients with AD compared to normal donors and were correlated in both groups. Serum levels of LL-37 correlated with those of oncostatin M and IL-31 in normal donors and patients with AD, while 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels did so only in normal donors. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 increased LL-37 production in human keratinocytes and neutrophils. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and LL-37 enhanced the oncostatin M and IL-31 production in CD3/28-stimulated T cells, but did not alter IL-25 and TSLP production in TNF-α-stimulated keratinocytes. In CD3/28-stimulated T cells, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 reduced the IL-22 production, while LL-37 enhanced it. These effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and LL-37 were suppressed  by vitamin D receptor antagonist and pertussis toxin, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic vitamin D3 levels are reduced in patients with AD, which may contribute to decreased systemic LL-37 levels. LL-37 may systemically potentiate the oncostatin M and IL-31 production in normal donors and patients with AD, while vitamin D3 may do so only in normal donors.  © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Urea uptake enhances barrier function and antimicrobial defense in humans by regulating epidermal gene expression.  Grether-Beck S(1), Felsner I, Brenden H, Kohne Z, Majora M, Marini A, Jaenicke T, Rodriguez-Martin M, Trullas C, Hupe M, Elias PM, Krutmann J.  Author information:  (1)Institut fuer Umweltmedizinische Forschung, Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, Düsseldorf, Germany. Grether-Beck@uni-duesseldorf.de  Urea is an endogenous metabolite, known to enhance stratum corneum hydration. Yet, topical urea anecdotally also improves permeability barrier function, and it appears to exhibit antimicrobial activity. Hence, we hypothesized that urea is not merely a passive metabolite, but a small-molecule regulator of epidermal structure and function. In 21 human volunteers, topical urea improved barrier function in parallel with enhanced antimicrobial peptide (AMP; LL-37 and β-defensin-2) expression. Urea stimulates the expression of, and is transported into, keratinocytes by two urea transporters (UTs), UT-A1 and UT-A2, and by aquaporins 3, 7, and 9. Inhibitors of these UTs block the downstream biological effects of urea, which include increased mRNA and protein levels of (i) transglutaminase-1, involucrin, loricrin, and filaggrin, (ii) epidermal lipid synthetic enzymes, and (iii) cathelicidin/LL-37 and β-defensin-2. Finally, we explored the potential clinical utility of urea, showing that topical urea applications normalized both barrier function and AMP expression in a murine model of atopic dermatitis. Together, these results show that urea is a small-molecule regulator of epidermal permeability barrier function and AMP expression after transporter uptake, followed by gene regulatory activity in normal epidermis, with potential therapeutic applications in diseased skin.

Eosinophil-derived leukotriene C4 signals via type 2 cysteinyl leukotriene receptor to promote skin fibrosis in a mouse model of atopic dermatitis.  Oyoshi MK(1), He R, Kanaoka Y, ElKhal A, Kawamoto S, Lewis CN, Austen KF, Geha RS.  Author information:  (1)Division of Immunology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.  Atopic dermatitis (AD) skin lesions exhibit epidermal and dermal thickening, eosinophil infiltration, and increased levels of the cysteinyl leukotriene (cys-LT) leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)). Epicutaneous sensitization with ovalbumin of  WT mice but not ΔdblGATA mice, the latter of which lack eosinophils, caused skin  thickening, collagen deposition, and increased mRNA expression of the cys-LT generating enzyme LTC(4) synthase (LTC(4)S). Skin thickening and collagen deposition were significantly reduced in ovalbumin-sensitized skin of LTC(4)S-deficient and type 2 cys-LT receptor (CysLT(2)R)-deficient mice but not type 1 cys-LT receptor (CysLT(1)R)-deficient mice. Adoptive transfer of bone marrow-derived eosinophils from WT but not LTC(4)S-deficient mice restored skin thickening and collagen deposition in epicutaneous-sensitized skin of ΔdblGATA recipients. LTC(4) stimulation caused increased collagen synthesis by human skin  fibroblasts, which was blocked by CysLT(2)R antagonism but not CysLT(1)R antagonism. Furthermore, LTC(4) stimulated skin fibroblasts to secrete factors that elicit keratinocyte proliferation. These findings establish a role for eosinophil-derived cys-LTs and the CysLT(2)R in the hyperkeratosis and fibrosis of allergic skin inflammation. Strategies that block eosinophil infiltration, cys-LT production, or the CysLT(2)R might be useful in the treatment of AD.  DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1203127109  PMCID: PMC3323994	22416124

Kirschner N(1), Rosenthal R, Günzel D, Moll I, Brandner JM.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology and Venerology, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany Institute of Clinical Physiology, Charité, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany.  Skin barrier function is indispensable to prevent the uncontrolled loss of water  and solutes and to protect the body from external assaults. To fulfil this function, keratinocytes undergo a complex pathway of differentiation that terminates in the formation of the stratum corneum. Additionally, tight junctions (TJs), which are cell-cell junctions localized in the stratum granulosum, are involved in the barrier function of the skin. Important biological and clinical roles of TJs are strongly suggested by altered TJ protein levels and distribution in skin diseases like psoriasis, ichthyosis and atopic dermatitis. Because these  skin diseases show alterations in differentiation and TJs, it was suggested that  changes in TJs might simply be a consequence of altered differentiation. However, in this viewpoint, we like to argue that the situation is not as simple and depends on the specific microenvironment. We discuss three hypotheses regarding the interplay between TJs/TJ proteins and differentiation: (1) TJs/TJ proteins are influenced by differentiation, (2) differentiation is influenced by TJs/TJ proteins, and (3) TJs/TJ proteins and differentiation are independent of each other. In addition, the concept is introduced that both processes are going on at the same time, which means that while one specific TJ protein/barrier component might be influenced by differentiation, the other may influence differentiation.  © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, PO Box  9101, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands. h.dekoning@derma.umcn.nl  BACKGROUND: Recent studies have emphasized the importance of heritable and acquired skin barrier abnormalities in common inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD). To date, no comprehensive studies on the effect of experimental barrier disruption on cornified envelope protein expression have been performed. OBJECTIVES: To analyse the effect of experimental skin barrier disruption on the  expression of cornified envelope structural proteins and keratinocyte differentiation-regulating proteins. METHODS: We examined mRNA (day 1, 3 and 7) and protein (day 1, 2, 4 and 9) expression levels of structural proteins and regulatory molecules after sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) application on normal skin, and tape stripping of uninvolved epidermis of patients with psoriasis and AD and healthy controls. RESULTS: Upon tape stripping, several structural molecules were significantly downregulated (at the mRNA level as well as the protein level), including LCE5A,  LCE2B, FLG, FLG2 and LOR, whereas others were upregulated: IVL, SPRR1, SPRR2, HRNR and most notably LCE3A. The epidermal crosslinking enzymes TGM1, TGM3 and TGM5 were all upregulated, whereas proteases involved in the desquamation process (CTSV, KLK5 and KLK7) were downregulated or unaffected. Most results were similar in SDS-instigated irritant contact dermatitis. There was no significant difference in response between normal epidermis and nonlesional skin of patients  with psoriasis and AD. CONCLUSIONS: Skin barrier disruption induces a temporary barrier repair response  composed of increased expression of several cornification-related proteins, and decreased expression of some structural and desquamation-related proteins.  © 2012 The Authors.

Notch activation by the metalloproteinase ADAM17 regulates myeloproliferation and atopic barrier immunity by suppressing epithelial cytokine synthesis.

Epithelial cells of mucosal tissues provide a barrier against environmental stress, and keratinocytes are key decision makers for immune cell function in the skin. Currently, epithelial signaling networks that instruct barrier immunity remain uncharacterized. Here we have shown that keratinocyte-specific deletion of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (Adam17) triggers T helper 2 and/or T helper 17 (Th2 and/or Th17) cell-driven atopic dermatitis and myeloproliferative  disease. In vivo and in vitro deficiency of ADAM17 dampened Notch signaling, increasing production of the Th2 cell-polarizing cytokine TSLP and myeloid growth factor G-CSF. Ligand-independent Notch activation was identified as a regulator of AP-1 transcriptional activity, with Notch antagonizing c-Fos recruitment to the promoters of Tslp and Csf3 (G-CSF). Further, skin inflammation was rescued and myeloproliferation ameliorated by delivery of active Notch to Adam17(-)(/-) epidermis. Our findings uncover an essential role of ADAM17 in the adult epidermis, demonstrating a gatekeeper function of the ADAM17-Notch-c-Fos triad in barrier immunity.  Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Author information:  (1)Unit of Immunotoxicology, Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, Helsinki,  Finland.  Comment in     J Invest Dermatol. 2012 May;132(5):1326-9.  In the acute phase of atopic dermatitis (AD), T-helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines characterize the inflammatory response in the skin. IL-33 is a new tissue-derived cytokine, which is mainly expressed by cells of barrier tissues, and is known to  activate Th2 lymphocytes, mast cells, and eosinophils. IL-33 signals through a receptor complex consisting of IL-33-specific receptor ST2 and a co-receptor IL-1RAcP. As IL-33 is known to promote Th2-type immunity, we examined expression  profiles of IL-33 and its receptor components in human AD skin, in the murine model of AD, and in various cell models. We found increased expression of IL-33 and ST2 in AD skin after allergen or staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) exposure, as well as in the skin of 22-week-old filaggrin-deficient mice. In addition, skin fibroblasts, HaCaT keratinocytes, primary macrophages, and HUVEC endothelial cells efficiently produced IL-33 in response to the combined stimulation of tumor necrosis factor-α and IFN-γ, which was further enhanced by a mimetic of double-stranded RNA. Finally, the increased expression of IL-33 and ST2 caused by irritant, allergen, or SEB challenge was suppressed by topical tacrolimus treatment. These results suggest an important role for IL-33-ST2 interaction in AD and highlight the fact that bacterial and viral infections may increase the production of IL-33.

Author information:  (1)Department of Pediatrics, Taipei Hospital, Department of Health, Taipei, Taiwan.  Keratinocyte apoptosis is a key pathogenetic mechanism in atopic dermatitis (AD). Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) interaction is an important pathway to induce apoptosis. However, the relationship between early life soluble FasL (sFasL) and  AD still is not clear. This study was designed to evaluate if sFasL is associated with the development of AD in children. We performed a nested case-control study  within a prospective Taiwan birth-panel cohort study. Umbilical cord blood and maternal plasma samples were gathered at birth. During follow-up, using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaires, we identified 40 AD cases, which we matched to 80 unaffected controls chosen from this cohort. The concentrations of sFasL and immunoglobulin E in plasma were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The relationship of sFasL levels and AD was estimated by mix model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to see how well sFasL could predict AD. Cord blood sFasL levels were significantly higher in the AD patients than in the controls (p = 0.003). The concentration of sFasL in the cord blood was higher than in the maternal blood (p < 0.001). There also existed a correlation between the concentration of  sFasL in the maternal blood and the cord blood (r = 0.23; p = 0.01). The subjective severity of AD was positively correlated with sFasL levels (r = 0.34;  p = 0.02). Cold blood sFasL may be a biomarker in detecting pediatric AD (area under the ROC curve = 0.64). Our results showed a relation between cord blood sFasL and the development of AD in children.  DOI: 10.2500/aap.2011.32.3468 	22195689

As both have a role in skin function and  pathology, we first sought to investigate the expression pattern of AKR1C3 in normal human epidermis. Immunofluorescence revealed a strong expression of AKR1C3 in the differentiated suprabasal layers compared with the basal layer. Western blot analysis and quantitative PCR confirmed that AKR1C3 expression was also upregulated in differentiation-induced primary human keratinocytes (PHKs). To investigate the functional role of AKR1C3 during PHK differentiation, its expression and activity (measured as PGD(2) reduction to 9α,11β-PGF(2) by ELISA)  were impaired by small interfering RNA or 2'-hydroxyflavanone, respectively. Cytokeratin 10 (K10) and loricrin expression were then examined by western blot analysis, thus revealing altered expression of these differentiation markers. Finally, following an observation that the AD-associated mediator, PGD(2), upregulated AKR1C3 expression in PHKs, we used immunofluorescence to examine AKR1C3 expression in AD and psoriasis lesions. AKR1C3 was found to be upregulated in AD but not in psoriasis lesions compared with non-lesional skin. Our work demonstrates a function for AKR1C3 in differentiation-associated gene regulation  and also suggests a role in supporting inflammation in AD.

Increased serum human β-defensin-2 levels in atopic dermatitis: relationship to IL-22 and oncostatin M.  Kanda N(1), Watanabe S.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Teikyo University, School of Medicine, 11-1, Kaga-2, Itabashi-Ku, Tokyo 173-8605, Japan. nmk@med.teikyo-u.ac.jp  Atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with dysregulated expression of human β-defensins (hBDs) and infiltration of T cells producing cytokines which regulate hBD expression. We examined serum levels of hBDs and cytokines in AD patients, the effects of cytokines on hBD production in human keratinocytes, and those of hBDs on cytokine production in human peripheral blood-derived T cells. Levels of  serum hBD-2, IL-22, and oncostatin M, but not hBD-3, were higher in AD patients than in normal donors. Serum hBD-2 levels of AD patients correlated with AD scoring and IL-22 levels. IL-22 and oncostatin M enhanced hBD-2 production and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activities strongly and hBD-3 production moderately in human keratinocytes. STAT3 inhibitor suppressed IL-22 and oncostatin M-induced production of hBD-2 and hBD-3. hBD-2 strongly and hBD-3 moderately enhanced IL-22 and oncostatin M production, whereas hBD-3 strongly and hBD-2 moderately enhanced IL-31, IL-13, and IL-4 production in CD3/28-stimulated T cells. hBD-2 induced phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and Akt, while hBD-3 induced phosphorylation of inhibitory κB kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Akt in CD3/28-stimulated T cells. Inhibitors of these signals attenuated hBD-2- or hBD-3-induced production of cytokines. These results suggest that serum hBD-2 may be a biomarker of skin inflammation. IL-22 and oncostatin M may enhance hBD-2 production via STAT3 in keratinocytes, while hBD-2 may enhance IL-22 and oncostatin M production in T cells. hBD-3 may enhance T(H)2 responses.

CXCL16 and CXCR6 are upregulated in psoriasis and mediate cutaneous recruitment of human CD8+ T cells.  Günther C(1), Carballido-Perrig N, Kaesler S, Carballido JM, Biedermann T.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University Hospital, Technical University Dresden,  Dresden, Germany. claudia.guenther@uniklinikum-dresden.de  Psoriatic skin lesions are characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate, consisting of dendritic cells, monocytes, and both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Although the chemokines involved in the migration of CD4(+) T cells  into psoriatic skin are well characterized, those regulating CD8(+) T-cell recruitment are less understood. We found that the percentages of peripheral blood CD8(+) T cells expressing CXCR6 were higher in psoriatic patients than in healthy or atopic individuals. In addition, CXCR6 expression in psoriatic patients was more abundant in the CD8(+) than in the CD4(+) T-cell compartment. CXCR6 mRNA expression was also stronger in skin CD8(+) T cells than in the corresponding blood-derived counterparts. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed profound upregulation of the CXCR6 ligand CXCL16 by monocytes, keratinocytes, and dendritic cells in psoriatic skin compared with healthy or atopic dermatitis skin. In line with this, CXCR6(+) CD8(+) T cells also were most prevalent in psoriatic skin. Furthermore, CXCL16 induced Ca(2+) influx and chemotactic migration of psoriatic skin-derived CD8(+) T cells in vitro. Most importantly, CXCL16 potently recruited human CD8(+) T cells to human skin grafts previously transplanted onto SCID mice in vivo. These investigations indicate that CXCL16-CXCR6 interactions mediate homing of CD8(+) T cells into human skin, and thereby contribute to psoriasis pathogenesis.  DOI: 10.1038/jid.2011.371 	22113484

Sun XD(1), You Y, Zhang L, Zheng S, Hong Y, Li J, Gao XH.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Shenyang No. 7 People's Hospital, Shenyang 110003,  China.  Skin barrier dysfunction is involved in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD). The impaired barrier function is related to disturbed keratinocyte differentiation through improper Ca2+-regulated pathway in AD. Transient receptor potential canonical (subtype) 6 (TRPC6) is a Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channel expressed in keratinocytes. TRPC6 contributes to the process of keratinocyte differentiation by regulating Ca2+ influx. Furthermore, TRPC6 alone  is considered to be sufficient for nearly full physiological response of keratinocyte differentiation. Until now, the correlation between TRPC6 and AD has not been investigated. We hypothesize that dysfunction of TRPC6 may trigger the process of AD, and that restoring or enhancing the activity of TRPC6 may serve as a new modality in treating AD.  Copyright © 2011.

Author information:  (1)Allergie-Centrum-Charité, CCM, Klinik für Dermatologie und Allergologie, Charité -Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.  Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease that has increased in prevalence over the last several decades in industrialized countries. AD is a multifactorial, heterogenous disease with a variety of defects in the immune system, in antimicrobial defense mechanisms and epidermal barrier integrity, which collectively contribute to the risk and severity of AD development. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling has been shown to be important not only in the immune system but also in the skin and in particular keratinocytes to regulate skin homeostasis and epidermal barrier function. However, this work aimed to analyze the role and clinical efficiency of VDR activation by a VDR agonist without calcium-mobilizing activity in a mouse model  of allergen-triggered eczema. We show that the systemic administration of the low-calcemic VDR agonist significantly improved the allergen-triggered eczema. Thereby, forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)-expressing regulatory T cells, revealed to have  a role in AD, were selectively increased in the skin of VDR agonist-treated mice. Moreover, our results demonstrate a marked induction of skin barrier gene and antimicrobial peptide gene expression in skin lesions of VDR agonist-treated mice. Thus, our study provides evidence that systemic VDR agonist treatment may improve allergen-triggered eczema in vivo.  DOI: 10.1038/jid.2011.296 	21938012

Involvement of leukotriene B4 in spontaneous itch-related behaviour in NC mice with atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions.  Andoh T(1), Haza S, Saito A, Kuraishi Y.  Author information:  (1)Department of Applied Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.  To elucidate the mechanisms of severe itch in atopic dermatitis, we investigated  the role of leukotriene B(4) , a potent itch mediator, in spontaneous itch-related behaviour in NC mice with atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions. Topical application of the BLT leukotriene B(4) receptor antagonist ONO-4057 inhibited spontaneous itch-related behaviour. The concentration of leukotriene B(4) was significantly increased in the lesional skin. The expression levels of 5-lipoxygenase were also elevated in the lesional skin, yet present throughout the epidermis of both healthy and lesional skin. These results suggest a role for leukotriene B(4) in chronic dermatitis-related itch. Sphingosylphosphorylcholine  (SPC) was increased in the epidermis of the lesional skin. Moreover, intradermal  injection of SPC elicited itch-related behaviours in healthy mice. Because SPC induces itch-related responses through the production of leukotriene B(4) in keratinocytes (J Invest Dermatol, 129, 2009, 2854), these results suggest that an increase in SPC induces leukotriene B(4) -mediated itching in chronic dermatitis. BLT1 receptor and 5-lipoxygenase in the skin may be effective pharmacological targets for the treatment of itch in atopic dermatitis.  © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Author information:  (1)Cutaneous Medicine and Immunotherapy Unit, St. John's Institute of Dermatology, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, United Kingdom.  γδ T cells mediate rapid tissue responses in murine skin and participate in cutaneous immune regulation including protection against cancer. The role of human γδ cells in cutaneous homeostasis and pathology is characterized poorly. In this study, we show in vivo evidence that human blood contains a distinct subset  of proinflammatory cutaneous lymphocyte Ag and CCR6-positive Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, which is rapidly recruited into perturbed human skin. Vγ9Vδ2 T cells produced an  array of proinflammatory mediators including IL-17A and activated keratinocytes in a TNF-α- and IFN-γ-dependent manner. Examination of the common inflammatory skin disease psoriasis revealed a striking reduction of circulating Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in psoriasis patients compared with healthy controls and atopic dermatitis  patients. Decreased numbers of circulating Vγ9Vδ2 T cells normalized after successful treatment with psoriasis-targeted therapy. Taken together with the increased presence of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in psoriatic skin, these data indicate redistribution of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells from the blood to the skin compartment in psoriasis. In summary, we report a novel human proinflammatory γδ T cell involved in skin immune surveillance with immediate response characteristics and with potential clinical relevance in inflammatory skin disease.

Foster EL(1), Simpson EL, Fredrikson LJ, Lee JJ, Lee NA, Fryer AD, Jacoby DB.  Author information:  (1)Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, United States of America.  Cutaneous nerves are increased in atopic dermatitis, and itch is a prominent symptom. We studied the functional interactions between eosinophils and nerves in human and mouse skin and in culture. We demonstrated that human atopic dermatitis skin has eosinophil granule proteins present in the same region as increased nerves. Transgenic mice in which interleukin-5 (IL-5) expression is driven by a keratin-14 (K14) promoter had many eosinophils in the epidermis, and the number of nerves was also significantly increased in the epidermis. In co-cultures, eosinophils dramatically increased branching of sensory neurons isolated from the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of mice. This effect did not occur in DRG neurons co-cultured with mast cells or with dead eosinophils. Physical contact of the eosinophils with the neurons was not required, and the effect was not blocked by  an antibody to nerve growth factor. DRG neurons express eotaxin-1, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, which may be important in the recruitment, binding, and activation of eosinophils in the region of cutaneous nerves. These data indicate a pathophysiological role for eosinophils in cutaneous nerve growth in atopic dermatitis, and suggest they may present a therapeutic target in atopic dermatitis and other eosinophilic skin conditions with neuronal symptoms such as  itch.

Song HY(1), Ju SM, Goh AR, Kwon DJ, Choi SY, Park J.  Author information:  (1)Department of Biomedical Science, Research Institute for Bioscience & Biotechnology, Hallym University, Chunchon, Korea.  Up-regulation of selected matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as MMP-9 contributes to inflammatory processes during the development of various skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis. In this study, we examined the effect of a cell-permeable superoxide dismutase (Tat-SOD) on TNF-α-induced MMP-9 expression in human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT). When Tat-SOD was added to the culture medium of HaCaT cells, it rapidly entered the cells in dose- and time-dependent manners. Tat-SOD decreased TNF-α-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Tat-SOD also inhibited TNF-α-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity. Treatment of HaCaT cells with Tat-SOD significantly inhibited TNF-α-induced mRNA and protein expression of MMP-9, as measured by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. In addition, Tat-SOD suppressed TNF-α-induced gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9. Taken together, our results indicate that Tat-SOD can suppress TNF-α-induced MMP-9 expression via ROS-NF-κB-dependent mechanisms in keratinocytes, and therefore can be used as an  immunomodulatory agent against inflammatory skin diseases related to oxidative stress.

The expression of BAFF, APRIL and TWEAK is altered in eczema skin but not in the  circulation of atopic and seborrheic eczema patients.  Chen Y(1), Lind Enoksson S, Johansson C, Karlsson MA, Lundeberg L, Nilsson G, Scheynius A, Karlsson MC.  Author information:  (1)Clinical Allergy Research Unit, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden.  The TNF family cytokines BAFF (B-cell activating factor of the TNF family) and APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand) are crucial survival factors for B-cell development and activation. B-cell directed treatments have been shown to improve atopic eczema (AE), suggesting the involvement of these cytokines in the pathogenesis of AE. We therefore analyzed the expression of these TNF cytokines in AE, seborrheic eczema (SE) and healthy controls (HC). The serum/plasma concentration of BAFF, APRIL and a close TNF member TWEAK (TNF-like weak inducer  of apoptosis) was measured by ELISA. The expression of these cytokines and their  receptors in skin was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Unlike other inflammatory diseases including autoimmune diseases and asthma, the  circulating levels of BAFF, APRIL and TWEAK were not elevated in AE or SE patients compared with HCs and did not correlate with the disease severity or systemic IgE levels in AE patients. Interestingly, we found that the expression of these cytokines and their receptors was altered in positive atopy patch test reactions in AE patients (APT-AE) and in lesional skin of AE and SE patients. The expression of APRIL was decreased and the expression of BAFF was increased in eczema skin of AE and SE, which could contribute to a reduced negative regulatory input on B-cells. This was found to be more pronounced in APT-AE, the initiating  acute stage of AE, which may result in dysregulation of over-activated B-cells. Furthermore, the expression levels of TWEAK and its receptor positively correlated to each other in SE lesions, but inversely correlated in AE lesions. These results shed light on potential pathogenic roles of these TNF factors in AE and SE, and pinpoint a potential of tailored treatments towards these factors in  AE and SE.

Author information:  (1)Atopy (Allergy) Research Center, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.  Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) causes keratinocytes to release thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), which plays a key role in allergic diseases. Endosomal Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and cytosolic RIG-like receptors (RLRs) and PKR have  been reported to recognize dsRNA. Here, we demonstrate that dsRNA induces TSLP in keratinocytes via an endosomal acidification-dependent and NF-κB-mediated pathway. After treatment with pharmacologic inhibitors or transfection with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), primary human keratinocytes were stimulated. Bafilomycin A1, which inhibits endosomal acidification to block the TLR3 pathway, blocked the dsRNA-induced expression of TSLP, IL-8, IFN-β, and other molecules including the dsRNA sensors, whereas it did not inhibit diacyllipopeptide-induced expression of TSLP and IL-8. The dsRNA-induced gene expression of TSLP depended on RelA, a component of NF-κB, but not IRF3, similar to IL-8 but different from IFN-β, which depended on both IRF3 and RelA. The results indicate that endosomal  acidification and the subsequent activation of NF-κB are necessary to sense extracellular dsRNA, suggesting the importance of the TLR3-NF-κB axis to trigger  production of TSLP against the self dsRNA released from damaged cells or viral dsRNA, in the epidermis, relating to skin inflammation including atopic dermatitis (AD).

Author information:  (1)Department of Medicine, Division of Dermatology, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, California 92121, USA. rgallo@ucsd.edu  Skin protects itself against infection through a variety of mechanisms. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are major contributors to cutaneous innate immunity, and this system, combined with the unique ionic, lipid, and physical barrier of the epidermis, is the first-line defense against invading pathogens. However, recent studies have revealed that our skin's innate immune system is not solely of human origin. Staphylococcus epidermidis, a major constituent of the normal microflora on healthy human skin, acts as a barrier against colonization of potentially pathogenic microbes and against overgrowth of already present opportunistic pathogens. Our resident commensal microbes produce their own AMPs,  act to enhance the normal production of AMPs by keratinocytes, and are beneficial to maintaining inflammatory homeostasis by suppressing excess cytokine release after minor epidermal injury. These observations indicate that the normal human skin microflora protects skin by various modes of action, a conclusion supported  by many lines of evidence associating diseases such as acne, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and rosacea with an imbalance of the microflora even in the absence of classical infection. This review highlights recent observations on the importance of innate immune systems and the relationship with the normal skin microflora to  maintain healthy skin.

Author information:  (1)Hannover Medical School, Division of Immunodermatology and Allergy Research, Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Hannover, Germany. gutzmer.ralf@mh-hannover.de  Chronic inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD) are clinically  characterized by erythematous and pruritic skin lesions, immunologically mediated by an inflammatory infiltrate consisting of T-cells, antigen presenting cells (APC) and eosinophilic granulocytes. Histamine levels are increased in lesions of inflammatory skin diseases. It is likely that histamine also plays a pathogenetic role since various relevant cell types such as T-cells and APC express functional histamine receptors. However, therapeutic blockade of the histamine H1 and H2 receptor is inefficient at least in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. We summarize here current data on the role of the recently described histamine H4 receptor (H4R) in chronic inflammatory skin diseases. The H4R is functionally expressed on relevant cell types such as T-cells, APC and keratinocytes. In murine models of contact hypersensitivity and pruritus, H4R blockade had significant in vivo effects. Taken together, several lines of evidence suggest a  role of the H4R in chronic inflammatory skin disease and the H4R might be a therapeutic target for diseases such as AD.  	21622248

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany. birgit.schittek@med.uni-tuebingen.de  Keratinocytes represent the major cell population in the epithelial skin barrier  and actively participate in innate immune responses by recognizing pathogenic microorganisms, followed by a fine-tuned production of cytokines, chemokines and  antimicrobial peptides or proteins (AMPs). Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) suffer from a defective permeability barrier which favors pathogen infection indicating that the permeability and antimicrobial barrier functions are interdependent. Several early studies showed that the inducible AMPs LL-37, HBD-2 and HBD-3 are expressed at lower levels in atopic skin compared to psoriatic skin. However, recent data indicate that AMP induction is not compromised in AD patients and that several AMPs are expressed at significantly higher amounts in AD compared to healthy skin. AD patients have an increased susceptibility to Staphylococcus aureus skin infection suggesting that AMP levels expressed by keratinocytes of AD patients might not be sufficient to combat pathogenic skin infection or that AMP function is disturbed. Increasing AMP expression in AD skin and repairing the skin barrier defect might have a therapeutic effect in AD patients enabling the skin to mount an enhanced response to pathogens.

Regulation of caspase 14 expression in keratinocytes by inflammatory cytokines--a possible link between reduced skin barrier function and inflammation?  Hvid M(1), Johansen C, Deleuran B, Kemp K, Deleuran M, Vestergaard C.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermato-venereology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus C, Denmark.  Caspase 14 is a unique member of the cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase family. Its expression is confined primarily to cornified epithelium such as the  skin. Caspase 14 has been associated with the processing of filaggrin monomers and the development of natural moisturising factors of the skin, and thus, it could be speculated that caspase 14 dysregulation is implicated in the development of an impaired skin barrier function. We have investigated the regulation of caspase 14 transcription in cultured primary keratinocytes following stimulation with a number of factors present in inflamed skin, including T(H)1- and T(H)2-associated cytokines in addition to LPS and peptidoglycan. In particular, we found that T(H)2-associated cytokines reduced the caspase 14 mRNA level significantly. Furthermore, we found that the expression of caspase 14 was reduced in skin biopsies from patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), psoriasis and contact dermatitis, further supporting a role for  this kinase in inflammatory skin conditions. Hence, the regulation of caspase 14  levels provides a possible link between impaired skin barrier function and inflammatory reactions in skin diseases such as AD and may offer an explanation to the skin barrier dysfunction in inflamed skin lesions.  © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria.  Although it is widely accepted that filaggrin (FLG) deficiency contributes to an  abnormal barrier function in ichthyosis vulgaris and atopic dermatitis, the pathomechanism of how FLG deficiency provokes a barrier abnormality in humans is  unknown. We report here that the presence of FLG mutations in Caucasians predicts dose-dependent alterations in epidermal permeability barrier function. Although FLG is an intracellular protein, the barrier abnormality occurred solely via a paracellular route in affected stratum corneum. Abnormal barrier function correlated with alterations in keratin filament organization (perinuclear retraction), impaired loading of lamellar body contents, followed by nonuniform extracellular distribution of secreted organelle contents, and abnormalities in lamellar bilayer architecture. In addition, we observed reductions in corneodesmosome density and tight junction protein expression. Thus, FLG deficiency provokes alterations in keratinocyte architecture that influence epidermal functions localizing to the extracellular matrix. These results clarify how FLG mutations impair epidermal permeability barrier function.  Copyright © 2011 American Society for Investigative Pathology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Extra domain A-positive fibronectin-positive feedback loops and their association with cutaneous inflammatory disease.  McFadden JP(1), Basketter DA, Dearman RJ, Kimber IR.  Author information:  (1)Department of Cutaneous Allergy, St John's Institute of Dermatology, St Thomas' Hospital, SE1 7EH London, UK. john.mcfadden@kcl.ac.uk  Cutaneous inflammation can show Th1 or Th2 predominance, but the precise mechanisms by which such selectivity is determined are unknown. A recent study has demonstrated that Th1 cells, but not Th2 cells, produce an endogenous ligand  for Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, namely extradomain A+ fibronectin containing extra type III domain A (FnEDA+). As TLR4 stimulation leads to production of proinflammatory cytokines that recruit (via altered endothelial adhesion molecule expression and chemokine production) more Th1/Th17 cells, a positive feedback mechanism for Th1/Th17 inflammation exists. We propose that FnEDA+ positive feedback loops are a potential driver of Th1/Th17 inflammation. Conversely, the inflammatory EDA+ fibronectin loop is negatively regulated in atopic dermatitis,  Th2 cytokines actively suppress TLR4 expression of Th1 cytokines, and recruited Th2 cells do not produce FnEDA+. In psoriasis, there are multiple FnEDA+ loops, comprising inflammatory, keratinocyte, and autoimmune loops. In allergic contact  dermatitis, a single inflammatory loop operates. In atopic dermatitis, the FnEDA+ loop is actively suppressed by Th2 cytokines, and recruited Th2 cells do not "feedback" FnEDA+. We review endogenous ligands for TLR in relation to inflammatory disease, FnEDA+ function, and the potential role for FnEDA+ in psoriasis, allergic contact dermatitis, and atopic dermatitis.

Intrinsic alterations of pro-inflammatory mediators in unstimulated and TLR-2 stimulated keratinocytes from atopic dermatitis patients.  Niebuhr M(1), Heratizadeh A, Wichmann K, Satzger I, Werfel T.  Author information:  (1)Division of Immunodermatology and Allergy Research, Department of Dermatology  and Allergy, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. niebuhr.margarete@mh-hannover.de  In many patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), the disease is complicated by their enhanced susceptibility to bacterial skin infections, especially with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Resistance to bacterial skin infections, e.g.  S. aureus, is based on the function of intact innate immune mechanisms in the epidermis, mainly provided by keratinocytes. Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 recognizes components of S. aureus and is known to be expressed on keratinocytes. The aim of this study was to investigate intrinsic TLR-2 expression and cytokine  secretion upon TLR-2 stimulation with peptidoglycan (PGN), lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and N-palmitoyl-S-[2,3-bis(palmitoyl)-(2RS)-propyl]-(R)cysteinyl-alanyl-glycine (Pam3Cys) in keratinocytes from patients with AD compared to healthy controls. Human primary keratinocytes (HPKs) were cultivated from hair follicles of patients with AD and non-atopic healthy controls and stimulated with Pam3Cys, LTA and PGN. TLR-2, TLR-1 and TLR-6 expression were investigated at the mRNA level. IL-6, IL-8, chemokine C-C motif ligand (CCL)-20 and MMP-9 production were studied at the protein level. TLR-2, TLR-1 and TLR-6 were expressed on both HPKs from patients with AD as well as healthy controls without significant differences between these groups. HPKs from patients with AD had an intrinsically reduced capacity to produce IL-6, IL-8, CCL-20 and MMP-9 and responded less to TLR-2 stimulation compared to HPKs from healthy controls. Our findings show evidence for intrinsic alterations in HPKs from patients with AD compared to healthy controls and diminished responses upon TLR-2 stimulation that might contribute to the enhanced susceptibility to skin infections with S. aureus.  © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

TRPV1 antagonist can suppress the atopic dermatitis-like symptoms by accelerating skin barrier recovery.  Yun JW(1), Seo JA, Jeong YS, Bae IH, Jang WH, Lee J, Kim SY, Shin SS, Woo BY, Lee KW, Lim KM, Park YH.  Author information:  (1)Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Amorepacific Corporation R&D Center, 314-1, Bora-dong, Giheung-gu, Yongin 446-729, Republic of Korea.  BACKGROUND: Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) is a cation channel activated by diverse obnoxious stimuli like capsaicin, low pH or heat. Recently, it was revealed that TRPV1 might be deeply associated with skin permeability barrier function, suggesting that modulation of TRPV1 might be beneficial for the skin disorders with barrier damages. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether the blockade of TRPV1 activation might accelerate skin barrier recovery and alleviate atopic dermatitis (AD)-like symptoms, employing a novel TRPV1 antagonist, PAC-14028. METHODS: TRPV1 antagonistic effects of PAC-14028 in human keratinocytes and skin  were confirmed through capsaicin-evoked calcium influx assay and capsaicin-induced blood perfusion increase. Effects of PAC-14028 on skin barrier  recovery were examined in vivo tape-stripping-induced barrier disruption in hairless mice. To determine the effects of PAC-14028 on AD, Dermatophagoides farina (Df)- and oxazolone (OXZ)-induced AD models were employed. RESULTS: PAC-14028 could inhibit capsaicin-evoked calcium influx in keratinocytes at sub-micromolar concentrations. This potent TRPV1 antagonistic activity in keratinocytes was manifested in vivo as the blockade of capsaicin-induced blood perfusion increase, and the accelerated barrier recovery from tape-stripping-induced barrier damages in hairless mice. PAC-14028 could also attenuate dermatitis-associated barrier damages in Df and OXZ models as determined by lower TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss), reformation of neutral lipid layer and reversion of changes in loricrin and filaggrin expression. Importantly, along with accelerated recovery of skin barrier function, PAC-14028  alleviated the general AD-like symptoms, including serum IgE increase, mast cell  degranulation, scratching behavior and clinical severity of dermatitis. CONCLUSIONS: These results reflect that the blockade of TRPV1 activation can suppress the atopic dermatitis-like symptoms by accelerating skin barrier recovery.

Author information:  (1)Department of Pediatrics, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1-1 Minami-kogushi, Ube, Yamaguchi, 755-8505, Japan. rh@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp  OBJECTIVE: Human thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an epithelial cell-derived  cytokine, promotes inflammatory T helper type 2 cell (Th2) differentiation of naive CD4(+) T cells. TSLP is highly produced in keratinocytes of patients with atopic dermatitis and bronchial epithelia of patients with asthma and was thought to be a master switch for allergic inflammation. We sought to examine the effect  of TSLP in human monocytes/macrophages. METHODS: The effect of TSLP on the expression of cell surface antigens (CD11c, CD16, CD54, CD80, CD86, and HLA-DR) in peripheral blood CD14(+) monocytes/macrophages was examined. RESULTS: TSLP enhanced the expression of CD80 in peripheral blood CD14(+) monocytes/macrophages but not that of other cell surface antigens. It was associated with an increased percentage of CD14(dim/-), CD80(+), CD11c(+), and HLA-DR(+) cells, which was consistent with the increased differentiation of myeloid dendritic cells. CONCLUSIONS: TSLP induces CD80 expression in human peripheral blood CD14(+) monocytes/macrophages; this indicates monocyte/macrophage activation. This may be associated with their differentiation into myeloid dendritic cells.  DOI: 10.1007/s00011-011-0310-0 	21274737

Kasraie S(1), Niebuhr M, Baumert K, Werfel T.  Author information:  (1)Division of Immunodermatology and Allergy Research, Department of Dermatology  and Allergy, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. kasraie.sadaf@mh-hannover.de  BACKGROUND: Interleukin (IL)-31 is a T-cell cytokine acting through a heterodimeric receptor composed of IL-31RA and OSMR which is expressed on epithelial cells including keratinocytes. A major function of IL-31 in atopic dermatitis (AD) is the induction of pruritus in the skin. Inflammatory effects of IL-31 in human primary keratinocytes (HPKs) still remain unclear. We investigated expression, regulation of the IL-31 receptor as well as functions of IL-31 in HPKs. METHODS: Human primary keratinocytes were stimulated with TLR-2 ligands (Pam3Cys, lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycan), or Th1 and Th2 associated cytokines (IFN-γ  and IL-4), respectively. IL-31R expression and regulation as well as functional effects of IL-31 stimulation were then investigated at both the mRNA and protein  level and compared with HPKs from patients with AD. The STAT signalling pathway and TLR-2 expression were investigated using Western blot and Immunohistochemical stainings, respectively. RESULTS: Pam3Cys or IFN-γ significantly up-regulated IL-31RA and OSMR expression. IL-31 activated STAT-3 phosphorylation in HPKs which was augmented after preactivation with Pam3Cys or IFN-γ. IL-31 enhanced the secretion of CCL2 after up-regulation of the receptor with Pam3Cys or IFN-γ. However, this was not observed in keratinocytes from AD patients where an impaired TLR-2 expression was found. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our findings show a functional role of IL-31 in HPKs and provide a new link between TLR-2 ligands and IL-31 which might be dysregulated in AD. Altered function of IL-31 may have implications for cutaneous inflammation in eczema where skin colonization with Staphylococcus aureus and dysregulation of TLR-2 have been described.  © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and  Environmental Health, Japan.  T helper (Th) 17 cells have crucial functions in host defense, and dysregulated Th17 responses mediate a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Th17  cells coexpress interleukin (IL)-22, and its receptor is expressed on epidermal keratinocytes. IL-17 and IL-22 cooperatively enhance some immunological responses. A close relationship between IL-17 and the cutaneous milieu has been suggested by a number of observations. IL-17 induces the production of certain cytokines, chemokines and antimicrobial peptides by keratinocytes, and its cooperation with IL-22 has been documented. Recent findings have suggested that Th17 cells profoundly participate in the pathogenesis of certain skin disorders,  in particular, psoriasis. The concept of the subsets of T cells responsible for psoriasis has been modified in the order of Th1, T cytotoxic 1, and again Thl, and Thl7 cells. IL-22 is the strongest cytokine in the keratinocyte-proliferative ability. Since IL-22 is produced by Th17 cells, they are crucial for the proliferation of keratinocytes. Furthermore, IL-22 with the help of IL-17 can induce the critical events of psoriasis, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation, cytokine/chemokine (IL-8 etc.) production, and antimicrobial peptide elaboration. For maintaining Th17 cells, IL-23 is required and is released from tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS)-producing dendritic cells (TIP-DCs). TIP-DCs are activated via an autocrine mechanism by virtue of TNF-alpha. The above cytokine network in the pathogenesis of psoriasis has been proven by the therapeutic effectiveness of cytokine-blocking biologics. Antibodies against TNF-alpha or its soluble receptor have already been widely used in the treatment  of psoriasis. The involvement of Th17 cells has also been shown in allergen-specific immune responses. The percentage of Th17 cells is increased in  the peripheral blood of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and associated with  the severity of AD. Drug eruption is another disease where Th17 cells are involved in the pathogenesis. The percentage of circulating Th17 cells are increased in drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, etc. Th17 cells and IL-22 are increased in patients with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Since  IL-17 and IL-22 cooperatively stimulate keratinocytes to produce IL-8, keratinocyte-derived IL-8 contributes to the accumulation ofneutrophils in the lesional epidermis of this drug eruption.  	21226422

Nakahigashi K(1), Kabashima K, Ikoma A, Verkman AS, Miyachi Y, Hara-Chikuma M.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.  Aquaporin-3 (AQP3) is a water/glycerol-transporting protein expressed in keratinocytes of the epidermis. We previously showed that AQP3-mediated transport of water and glycerol is involved in keratinocyte migration and proliferation, respectively. However, the involvement of AQP3 in epidermal hyperplasia in skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD), is unknown. In this study, we found significantly increased AQP3 transcript and protein expression in the epidermis of human AD lesions. The upregulation of AQP3 expression in human keratinocytes by transfection with human AQP3 DNA plasmid was associated with increased cellular glycerol and ATP, as well as increased cell proliferation. Among several cytokines and chemokines produced in the skin, CCL17, which is highly expressed in AD, was found to be a strong inducer of AQP3 expression and enhanced keratinocyte proliferation. In mouse AD models, AQP3 was strongly overexpressed in the epidermis in wild-type mice. Epidermal hyperplasia was reduced in AQP3-deficient mice, with a decreased number of proliferating keratinocytes. These results suggest the involvement of AQP3 in epidermal hyperplasia by a mechanism involving upregulated AQP3 expression and consequent enhancement of keratinocyte proliferation.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Ludwig-Maximilian-University of Munich, Germany. andreas.wollenberg@lrz.uni-muenchen.de  Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a clinically defined, highly pruritic, chronic inflammatory skin disease. In AD patients, the combination of a genetic predisposition for skin barrier dysfunction and dysfunctional innate and adaptive immune responses leads to a higher frequency of bacterial and viral skin infections. The innate immune system quickly mobilizes an unspecific, standardized first-line defense against different pathogens. Defects in this system lead to barrier dysfunction which results in increased protein allergen penetration through the epidermis and predisposes to secondary skin infections. Two loss-of-function mutations in the epidermal filaggrin gene are associated with AD. Also, inducible endogenous antibiotics such as the antimicrobial peptides cathelicidin and the beta-defensins may show defective function in lesional AD skin. Eczema herpeticum is a disseminated viral infection almost exclusively diagnosed in AD patients, which is based on unmasking of the viral entry receptor nectin-1, lack of cathelicidin production by keratinocytes, and depletion of Type I IFN-producing plasmacytoid dendritic cells from AD skin. Future therapeutic approaches to AD may include enhancement of impaired innate in addition to downregulation of dysfunctional adaptive immunity.  DOI: 10.1007/s12016-010-8227-x 	21181301

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester,  NY 14642, USA.  BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by dry skin and a hyperactive immune response to allergens, 2 cardinal features that are caused in part by epidermal barrier defects. Tight junctions (TJs) reside immediately below the stratum corneum and regulate the selective permeability of the paracellular pathway. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the expression/function of the TJ protein claudin-1 in epithelium from AD and nonatopic subjects and screened 2 American populations for single nucleotide polymorphisms in the claudin-1 gene (CLDN1). METHODS: Expression profiles of nonlesional epithelium from patients with extrinsic AD, nonatopic subjects, and patients with psoriasis were generated using Illumina's BeadChips. Dysregulated intercellular proteins were validated by means of tissue staining and quantitative PCR. Bioelectric properties of epithelium were measured in Ussing chambers. Functional relevance of claudin-1 was assessed by using a knockdown approach in primary human keratinocytes. Twenty-seven haplotype-tagging SNPs in CLDN1 were screened in 2 independent populations with AD. RESULTS: We observed strikingly reduced expression of the TJ proteins claudin-1 and claudin-23 only in patients with AD, which were validated at the mRNA and protein levels. Claudin-1 expression inversely correlated with T(H)2 biomarkers.  We observed a remarkable impairment of the bioelectric barrier function in AD epidermis. In vitro we confirmed that silencing claudin-1 expression in human keratinocytes diminishes TJ function while enhancing keratinocyte proliferation.  Finally, CLDN1 haplotype-tagging SNPs revealed associations with AD in 2 North American populations. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these data suggest that an impairment in tight junctions contributes to the barrier dysfunction and immune dysregulation observed in AD subjects and that this may be mediated in part by reductions in claudin-1.

Author information:  (1)Department of Microbiology, Chungnam National University, Daejeon 301-747, South Korea.  The scaffolding adaptor protein p62/SQSTM1 (p62) has been shown to be an autophagy receptor that acts as a link between the ubiquitination and autophagy machineries. However, the roles of autophagy and p62 in human keratinocytes are not well understood. In this study, we show that keratinocyte autophagy negatively regulates p62 expression, which is essential for the prevention of excessive inflammation and the induction of cathelicidin in human keratinocytes.  Stimulation of TLR2/6 or TLR4 in primary human keratinocytes robustly activated autophagy pathways and up-regulated p62 expression through induction of NADPH oxidases 2 and 4 and the generation of reactive oxygen species. MyD88 and TNFR-associated factor 6, key signaling molecules that mediate TLR activation, played an essential role in the induction of autophagy and p62 expression. Additionally, blockade of autophagy significantly increased the generation of inflammatory cytokines and expression of p62 in primary human keratinocytes. Notably, silencing hp62 through RNA interference resulted in a significant decrease in NF-κB activation, inflammatory cytokine production, cathelicidin expression, and cell proliferation (as well as cyclin D1 expression) in keratinocytes. Epidermal expression of p62 was further found to be significantly  higher in psoriatic skin than in skin affected by atopic dermatitis or from healthy controls. Collectively, our data provide new insights into the roles of autophagy and p62 in controlling cutaneous inflammation.  DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.1001954 	21160040

[Article in Spanish]  López-Lerma I(1), Estrach MT.  Author information:  (1)Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Servicio de Dermatología, Barcelona, Spain. ilopez@aedv.es  INTRODUCTION: Cell adhesion molecules play a pivotal role in the establishment of T-cell populations in the skin. In this study, we quantify the expression of cell adhesion molecules in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and compare  it with the expression found in other skin diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Frozen material was obtained from 42 patients in 5 different groups: early CTCL, comprising patients with patch- and plaque-stage of mycosis fungoides (n=11); advanced CTCL (n=7), comprising patients with mycosis fungoides (n=3) and Sézary syndrome (n=4); inflammatory skin disease (n=12), comprising patients with psoriasis (n=9) and atopic dermatitis (n=3); chronic skin diseases with persistent plaques that do not fulfil the histological criteria for mycosis fungoides (pre-CTCL) (n=8); and healthy volunteers (n=4). Expression of the following cell adhesion molecules was analyzed: lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), ICAM-3, cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen, E-selectin, very late antigen 4, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, alphaEbeta7 integrin, and E-cadherin. RESULTS: The immunohistochemical analyses used here revealed statistically significant differences between CTCL and other skin diseases but not between early and advanced CTCL. The expression of alphaEbeta7 integrin and ICAM-3 in the epidermis per high-power field (400× magnification) allowed the different groups  to be distinguished from each other, except for advanced CTCL and pre-CTCL. There were statistically significant differences between advanced CTCL and pre-CTCL in  terms of the expression of E-selectin at 400× magnification and the expression of ICAM-1 in a honeycomb pattern in epidermal keratinocytes. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of cell adhesion molecules involved in the adhesion and migration of lymphocytes in the skin does not differ significantly between initial and advanced stages of CTCL.  	21159263

Hashimoto Y(1), Shuto T, Mizunoe S, Tomita A, Koga T, Sato T, Takeya M, Suico MA, Niibori A, Sugahara T, Shimasaki S, Sugiyama T, Scholte B, Kai H.  Author information:  (1)Department of Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences,  Global COE Cell Fate Regulation Research and Education Unit, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.  Pruritus, also known as itch, is a sensation that causes a desire to scratch. Prolonged scratching exacerbates skin lesions in several skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis. Here, we identify the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR/Cftr), an integral membrane protein that mediates transepithelial chloride transport, as a determinant factor in mice for the susceptibility to several cutaneous symptoms during mite infestation. Mice that endogenously express dysfunctional Cftr (Cftr(ΔF508/ΔF508)) show significant increase of scratching behavior and skin fibrosis after mite exposure. These phenotypes were due to the increased expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) that augments the sensitization of peripheral nerve fibers. Moreover, protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5)-positive neurites were abundant in the epidermis of mite-infested Cftr(ΔF508/ΔF508) mice. Furthermore, mite-infested Cftr(+/+) mice orally administered with a chloride channel inhibitor glibenclamide had higher scratching count and increased level of NGF than vehicle-treated mice. Consistently, mite extract-exposed primary and transformed human keratinocytes, treated with CFTR inhibitor, had significantly higher level of NGF mRNA compared  with vehicle-treated, mite extract-exposed cells. These results reveal that CFTR  in keratinocytes plays a critical role for the regulation of peripheral nerve function and pruritus sensation, and suggest that Cftr(ΔF508/ΔF508) mice may serve as a novel mouse model that represents NGF-dependent generation of pruritus.

Development of atopic dermatitis-like skin disease from the chronic loss of epidermal caspase-8.  Li C(1), Lasse S, Lee P, Nakasaki M, Chen SW, Yamasaki K, Gallo RL, Jamora C.  Author information:  (1)Division of Biological Sciences, Section of Cell and Developmental Biology, School of Medicine, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.  Atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory skin disease that affects approximately 20%  of children worldwide. Left untreated, the barrier function of the skin is compromised, increasing susceptibility to dehydration and infection. Despite its  prevalence, its multifactorial nature has complicated the unraveling of its etiology. We found that chronic loss of epidermal caspase-8 recapitulates many aspects of atopic dermatitis, including a spongiotic phenotype whereby intercellular adhesion between epidermal keratinocytes is disrupted, adversely affecting tissue architecture and function. Although spongiosis is generally thought to be secondary to edema, we found that suppression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity is sufficient to abrogate this defect. p38 MAPK induces matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression to cleave E-cadherin, which mediates keratinocyte cohesion in the epidermis. Thus, the conditional loss of caspase-8, which we previously found to mimic a wound response, can be used to gain insights into how these same wound-healing processes are commandeered in inflammatory skin diseases.

Flagellin induces the expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin in human keratinocytes via toll-like receptor 5.  Le TA(1), Takai T, Vu AT, Kinoshita H, Chen X, Ikeda S, Ogawa H, Okumura K.  Author information:  (1)Atopy Research Center, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.  BACKGROUND: Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), highly expressed by keratinocytes in skin lesions of atopic dermatitis patients and bronchial epithelial cells in asthma, plays a key role in allergic diseases. Information on triggers for the release of TSLP in keratinocytes is still limited. Keratinocytes express Toll-like receptor (TLR) 5, the ligand for which is flagellin, the major  structural protein of the flagella of Gram-negative bacteria. IL-4, IL-13 and TNF-α (Th2/TNF) are associated with allergic diseases. TGF-α, one of the ligands  for the epidermal growth factor receptor, is overexpressed in keratinocytes in atopic dermatitis. We investigated the induction of TSLP expression in keratinocytes stimulated with flagellin and its modulation by the Th2/TNF cytokines and TGF-α. METHODS: Primary human keratinocytes were stimulated with flagellin with or without cytokines. The TSLP released was measured by ELISA. Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: Stimulation of keratinocytes with flagellin induced the release of TSLP  protein and upregulation of the gene expression of TSLP and other pro-inflammatory molecules. The flagellin-induced release of TSLP was enhanced by the Th2/TNF cytokines or TGF-α. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of TLR5  expression suppressed the flagellin-induced TSLP gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Flagellin induces TSLP expression in keratinocytes via TLR5 and the  expression can be upregulated by a cytokine milieu with Th2/TNF or TGF-α, suggesting that exposure of barrier-defective skin to Gram-negative bacteria or environmental flagellin contributes to the initiation and/or amplification of Th2-type skin inflammation including atopic dermatitis through the induction of TSLP expression in keratinocytes.

TLR2 expression is increased in rosacea and stimulates enhanced serine protease production by keratinocytes.  Yamasaki K(1), Kanada K, Macleod DT, Borkowski AW, Morizane S, Nakatsuji T, Cogen AL, Gallo RL.  Author information:  (1)Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, VA San Diego Health Care System, San Diego, California, USA. kyamasaki@med.tohoku.ac.jp  A diverse environment challenges skin to maintain temperature, hydration, and electrolyte balance while also maintaining normal immunological function. Rosacea is a common skin disease that manifests unique inflammatory responses to normal environmental stimuli. We hypothesized that abnormal function of innate immune pattern recognition could explain the enhanced sensitivity of patients with rosacea, and observed that the epidermis of patients with rosacea expressed higher amounts of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) than normal patients. Increased expression of TLR2 was not seen in other inflammatory skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis or psoriasis. Overexpression of TLR2 on keratinocytes, treatment with TLR2 ligands, and analysis of TLR2-deficient mice resulted in a calcium-dependent release of kallikrein 5 from keratinocytes, a critical protease involved in the pathogenesis of rosacea. These observations show that abnormal TLR2 function may explain enhanced inflammatory responses to environmental stimuli and can act as a critical element in the pathogenesis of rosacea.

Author information:  (1)Division of Immunodermatology and Allergy Research, Department of Dermatology  and Allergy, Hannover Medical School, Ricklinger Str. 5, 30449, Hannover, Germany. mommert.susanne@mh-hannover.de  The pathology of atopic dermatitis is orchestrated on the cellular level by several different cell types in the characteristic skin lesions. In such lesions, histamine as a mediator of many biological functions is also present in high concentrations. Most of the cells involved in the inflammatory responses express  the histamine H1 and H2 receptors, but drugs targeting these receptors are not clinically effective. The discovery of the fourth histamine receptor, which is differentially expressed on immune and nonimmune cells, has shed new light on the actions of histamine in the complexity of atopic dermatitis. In this review, we describe a possible genetic impact on the expression level of the histamine H4 receptor and summarize the current data regarding the activity of the histamine H4 receptor on the key effector cells in atopic dermatitis. We do so in the context of whether the histamine H4 receptor offers a novel target for effective  treatments of inflammatory skin diseases.  DOI: 10.1007/s11882-010-0162-7 	21104170

Nerve growth factor partially recovers inflamed skin from stress-induced worsening in allergic inflammation.  Peters EM(1), Liezmann C, Spatz K, Daniltchenko M, Joachim R, Gimenez-Rivera A, Hendrix S, Botchkarev VA, Brandner JM, Klapp BF.  Author information:  (1)Charité Center 12 (CC12) for Internal Medicine and Dermatology, Department of  Psychosomatics, Psychoneuroimmunology of the Skin, Charité-University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany. eva.peters@charite.de  Neuroimmune dysregulation characterizes atopic disease, but its nature and clinical impact remain ill-defined. Induced by stress, the neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) may worsen cutaneous inflammation. We therefore studied the role of NGF in the cutaneous stress response in a mouse model for atopic dermatitis-like allergic dermatitis (AlD). Combining several methods, we found that stress increased cutaneous but not serum or hypothalamic NGF in telogen mice. Microarray analysis showed increased mRNAs of inflammatory and growth factors associated with NGF in the skin. In stress-worsened AlD, NGF-neutralizing antibodies markedly reduced epidermal thickening together with NGF, neurotrophin  receptor (tyrosine kinase A and p75 neurotrophin receptor), and transforming growth factor-β expression by keratinocytes but did not alter transepidermal water loss. Moreover, NGF expression by mast cells was reduced; this corresponded to reduced cutaneous tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA levels but not to changes in mast cell degranulation or in the T helper type 1 (Th1)/Th2 cytokine balance. Also, eosinophils expressed TNF receptor type 2, and we observed reduced eosinophil infiltration after treatment with NGF-neutralizing antibodies. We thus conclude that NGF acts as a local stress mediator in perceived stress and allergy and that increased NGF message contributes to worsening of cutaneous inflammation mainly by enhancing epidermal hyperplasia, pro-allergic cytokine induction, and allergy-characteristic cellular infiltration.

Staphylococcus aureus membrane and diacylated lipopeptide induce thymic stromal lymphopoietin in keratinocytes through the Toll-like receptor 2-Toll-like receptor 6 pathway.  Vu AT(1), Baba T, Chen X, Le TA, Kinoshita H, Xie Y, Kamijo S, Hiramatsu K, Ikeda S, Ogawa H, Okumura K, Takai T.  Author information:  (1)Atopy (Allergy) Research Center, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.  BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus heavily colonizes the lesions of patients with  atopic dermatitis (AD) and is known to trigger a worsening of AD. However, the exact mechanism by which S. aureus promotes AD is unknown. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), which is highly expressed by keratinocytes in skin lesions  of patients with AD and bronchial epithelial cells in asthmatic patients, represents a critical factor linking responses at interfaces between the body and the environment to allergic type 2 immune responses. OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine the ability of synthetic lipopeptides and S. aureus to induce TSLP expression in human keratinocytes and identify the pathway  of induction. METHODS: We stimulated primary human keratinocytes with lipopeptides and S. aureus-derived materials. The release and gene expression of TSLP were measured by means of ELISA and quantitative PCR, respectively. RESULTS: Diacylated lipopeptide upregulated the expression of TSLP and other proinflammatory molecules. Heat-killed S. aureus and the subcellular fractions of S. aureus induced TSLP's release, with the membranous fraction having the greatest activity. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of either Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 or TLR6 inhibited the diacylated lipopeptide- and S. aureus membrane-induced TSLP gene expression. S. aureus membrane- and diacylated lipopeptide-induced release of TSLP was enhanced by T(H)2/TNF-α cytokines and partially suppressed by IFN-γ and TGF-β. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that ligands for the TLR2-TLR6 heterodimer in S. aureus membranes, including diacylated lipoproteins, could promote T(H)2-type inflammation through TSLP production in keratinocytes, providing an overall picture of the vicious cycles between colonization by S. aureus and AD in the T(H)2-skewed sensitization process, exacerbation of the disease, or both.

Sivaprasad U(1), Warrier MR, Gibson AM, Chen W, Tabata Y, Bass SA, Rothenberg ME, Khurana Hershey GK.  Author information:  (1)Division of Asthma Research, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.  IL-13 is expressed in lesions of atopic dermatitis (AD) and has been associated with increased disease severity. IL-13 has two cognate receptors: IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2. Although IL-13Rα2 expression is known to be induced in response to IL-13 in keratinocytes, its function in AD has never been evaluated. We characterized the loss of skin barrier function and the development of cutaneous  inflammation in IL-13Rα2-null versus wild-type BALB/c mice following an epicutaneous allergen-sensitization/challenge model that shares similarities with human AD. Mice lacking IL-13Rα2 had significantly increased transepidermal water  loss, cutaneous inflammation, peripheral eosinophilia, and IgG1 and IgE levels compared with wild-type mice. The rate of resolution of the cutaneous inflammation was not significantly altered in the IL-13Rα2-null mice. IL-13 induced expression of IL-13Rα2 in keratinocyte cell lines and primary human keratinocytes. Depletion of IL-13Rα2 in a keratinocyte cell line resulted in increased STAT6 signaling in response to IL-13. In conclusion, IL-13Rα2 serves a  protective role in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation and loss of skin barrier function in a mouse model of AD, suggesting that it may be an important endogenous regulator of IL-13-induced cutaneous inflammation in humans.

Cytosolic StAR-related lipid transfer domain 4 (STARD4) protein influences keratinocyte lipid phenotype and differentiation status.  Elbadawy HM(1), Borthwick F, Wright C, Martin PE, Graham A.  Author information:  (1)Department of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Glasgow Caledonian University, UK.  BACKGROUND: Terminally differentiating keratinocytes actively synthesize and accumulate cholesterol, which is a key constituent of intercellular lipid lamellae which contribute to the epidermal permeability barrier. While the pathway for cholesterol biosynthesis is established, intracellular transport mechanisms for this lipid are poorly understood, despite their importance in regulating organelle sterol content, keratinocyte differentiation status and the  activity of lipid-responsive transcription factors involved in skin health, repair and disease. Recent data implicate proteins containing a steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)-related lipid transfer (START) domain in cellular cholesterol homeostasis. OBJECTIVES: To investigate gene expression of cytosolic, cholesterol-binding StAR-related lipid transfer domain 4 (STARD4) protein in primary human keratinocytes and differentiating HaCaT keratinocytes and, by overexpression of this protein, the function of STARD4 in HaCaT keratinocyte lipid phenotype and differentiation status. METHODS: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was utilized to measure gene expression of STARD4 relative to the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Following transient (48 h) overexpression of STARD4, keratinocyte lipid mass and lipogenesis were measured, along with expression of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis and  those encoding a range of keratinocyte differentiation markers. RESULTS: Cholesterol-binding protein STARD4 is expressed in both primary and immortalized HaCaT keratinocytes, and is repressed during Ca(2+) -dependent differentiation of the latter. Transient overexpression of STARD4 reduces endogenous [(14) C]cholesterol and cholesteryl ester biosynthesis, and triggers increased expression of SREBF2, ABCG4 and LOR, while repressing expression of ABCA1. CONCLUSIONS: The cytosolic cholesterol-sensing protein STARD4 modulates both keratinocyte cholesterol homeostasis and differentiation status, increasing the efficiency of cholesterol trafficking within the cell, and amplifying and 'fine-tuning' cellular responses to this sterol. Modulation of expression of STARD4, and other members of the START family of lipid trafficking proteins, may  prove useful in resolving imbalances in lipid metabolism associated with loss of  epidermal barrier function in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.  © 2011 The Authors.

TNF receptor I on human keratinocytes is a binding partner for staphylococcal protein A resulting in the activation of NF kappa B, AP-1, and downstream gene transcription.  Classen A(1), Kalali BN, Schnopp C, Andres C, Aguilar-Pimentel JA, Ring J, Ollert M, Mempel M.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Biederstein, Technische Universität München, München, Germany.  Primary human keratinocytes and immortalized HaCaT cells were analysed for their  capacity to bind purified staphylococcal protein A (SpA). Co-incubation with FITC-labelled SpA led to a dose-depending attachment. Pull-down experiments with  cellular extracts revealed the TNFα receptor I (TNF RI) as binding partner on keratinocytes. Thus, we next looked for expression of this receptor in human epidermis and cultured keratinocytes. TNF RI is strongly expressed on all keratinocytes analysed, both at the mRNA and protein level and activation by SpA  at optimal doses of 50-100 μg/ml resulted in the phosphorylation of the TNF RI downstream kinases MEK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 subsequently leading to translocation  of the p65 NF kappa B subunit and AP-1 into the nucleus. This translocation was then followed by increased expression of IL-8 and COX-2, two known NF kappa B-induced pro-inflammatory genes. To further test the relevance of our findings,  we analysed in vitro production of over 100 strains isolated from atopic eczema showing that more than 85% of the tested strains produced extracellular SpA in substantial amounts. Thus, besides superantigens, haemolysins, and other cell wall components, Staphylococcus aureus exerts pro-inflammatory stimuli on human keratinocytes through the production of SpA signalling through TNF RI.  © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Transcriptional profiling after lipid raft disruption in keratinocytes identifies critical mediators of atopic dermatitis pathways.  Mathay C(1), Pierre M, Pittelkow MR, Depiereux E, Nikkels AF, Colige A, Poumay Y.  Author information:  (1)Cell and Tissue Laboratory, URPHYM, University of Namur (FUNDP), Namur, Belgium.  Lipid rafts are cholesterol-rich cell signaling platforms, and their physiological role can be explored by cholesterol depletion. To characterize transcriptional changes ongoing after lipid raft disruption in epidermal keratinocytes, a cell type that synthesizes its cholesterol in situ, we performed whole-genome expression profiling. Microarray results show that over 3,000 genes  are differentially regulated. In particular, IL-8, urokinase-like plasminogen activator receptor, and metalloproteinases are highly upregulated after cholesterol extraction. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR validation and protein release measurements demonstrate the physiological relevance of microarray data. Major enriched terms and functions, determined by Ingenuity Pathways Analysis, identify cholesterol biosynthesis as a major function, illustrating the specificity of keratinocyte response toward cholesterol depletion. Moreover, the inflammatory skin disorder atopic dermatitis (AD) is identified as the disease most closely associated with the profile of lipid raft-disrupted keratinocytes. This finding is confirmed in skin of AD patients, in whom transcript levels of major lipid raft target genes are similarly regulated in lesional atopic skin, compared with non-lesional and normal skin. Thus, lipid raft disruption evokes typical features of AD, thereby suggesting that lipid raft organization and signaling could be perturbed in atopic keratinocytes.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Division of Immunodermatology and Allergy Research, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. niebuhr.margarete@mh-hannover.de  BACKGROUND: Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis are frequently colonized with Staphylococcus aureus that produces staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) and α-toxin. In patients with AD, S aureus colonization is positively correlated with the severity of their eczema. Moreover, IL-22-producing cells have been shown to accumulate in AD skin and to correlate with disease severity. OBJECTIVE: To assess IL-22 production in response to SEB and sublytic α-toxin stimulation in patients with AD and psoriasis compared with healthy controls. METHODS: IL-22 induction was investigated in PBMCs, T cells, and autologous cocultures of keratinocytes and T cells on SEB and α-toxin stimulation in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner at the mRNA and protein (ELISA and flow  cytometry) level. Anti-IL-1 receptor or anti-IL-6 antibodies were used in blocking experiments. RESULTS: Staphylococcal enterotoxin B and sublytic α-toxin concentrations induced IL-22 production in PBMCs and isolated CD4(+) T cells. IL-22 secretion was enhanced by α-toxin stimulation in autologous cocultures of keratinocytes and T cells. In T cells and PBMCs from patients with AD, IL-22 secretion was significantly enhanced on α-toxin stimulation compared with patients with psoriasis and healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Increased IL-22 secretion induced by staphylococcal exotoxins in the  skin partially explains how skin colonization and infection with S aureus can contribute to chronic skin inflammation in AD.

Hvid M(1), Vestergaard C, Kemp K, Christensen GB, Deleuran B, Deleuran M.  Author information:  (1)Institute of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark. malenel@microbiology.au.dk  Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common skin disease associated with a T(H)2 response  and increased levels of T(H)2-associated cytokines and IgE. The mechanisms resulting in skewing the immune response in a T(H)2 direction in AD are not fully elucidated. However, such skewing has recently been associated with IL-25 in a murine model for allergic airway disease. The aim of this study was to investigate whether IL-25 may have a role in AD. We have identified IL-25-producing cells within the dermis of AD patients and propose that these cells are dendritic cells (DCs). This is supported by in vitro experiments that indicate that monocyte-derived DCs are capable of producing IL-25. As null mutations of filaggrin are associated with the development of an impaired skin barrier in AD, we investigated whether IL-25 affects filaggrin synthesis by keratinocytes. Using mRNA analysis, we have shown that IL-25 stimulation does indeed decrease filaggrin synthesis in cultured keratinocytes. These results suggest that IL-25 produced by DCs could have a dual role as both an inducer of the T(H)2 response and as an inhibitor of filaggrin synthesis, thereby directly affecting skin barrier function in AD patients.

A comprehensive analysis of pattern recognition receptors in normal and inflamed  human epidermis: upregulation of dectin-1 in psoriasis.  de Koning HD(1), Rodijk-Olthuis D, van Vlijmen-Willems IM, Joosten LA, Netea MG,  Schalkwijk J, Zeeuwen PL.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. h.dekoning@derma.umcn.nl  Human epidermis plays an important role in host defense by acting as a physical barrier and signaling interface between the environment and the immune system. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are crucial to maintain homeostasis and provide protection during infection, but are also causally involved in monogenic  auto-inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to investigate the epidermal expression of PRRs and several associated host defense molecules in healthy human skin, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis (AD). Using microarray analysis and real-time quantitative PCR, we found that many of these genes are transcribed in  normal human epidermis. Only a few genes were differentially induced in psoriasis (CLEC7A (dectin-1), Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, and mannose receptor C type 1 (MRC1)) or AD (MRC1, IL1RN, and IL1β) compared with normal epidermis. A remarkably high expression of dectin-1 mRNA was observed in psoriatic epidermis and this was corroborated by immunohistochemistry. In cultured primary human keratinocytes, dectin-1 expression was induced by IFN-γ, IFN-α, and Th17 cytokines. Keratinocytes were unresponsive, however, to dectin-1 ligands such as  β-glucan or heat-killed Candida albicans, nor did we observe synergy with TLR2/TLR5 ligands. In conclusion, upregulation of dectin-1 in psoriatic lesions seems to be under control of psoriasis-associated cytokines. Its role in the biology of skin inflammation and infection remains to be explored.  DOI: 10.1038/jid.2010.196 	20631729

Thymic stromal lymphopoietin-activated invariant natural killer T cells trigger an innate allergic immune response in atopic dermatitis.  Wu WH(1), Park CO, Oh SH, Kim HJ, Kwon YS, Bae BG, Noh JY, Lee KH.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Biology Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.  BACKGROUND: Although invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells have been shown to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of asthma, the role of iNKT cells in atopic dermatitis (AD) has not been well evaluated. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether iNKT cells in patients with AD increased and whether iNKT cells were activated by thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), which is highly expressed in keratinocytes of AD. METHODS: We assessed the population of iNKT cells in PBMCs of patients with AD and healthy controls (HCs) using flow cytometry. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate iNKT cells and TSLP expression in AD and HC skin. We also evaluated whether iNKT cells expressed the TSLP receptor, the effects of TSLP on iNKT cells, and iNKT cell-dendritic cell interactions in a TSLP-rich environment. RESULTS: There were more iNKT cells among PBMCs of patients with moderate to severe AD than mild AD (P < .05) and HC (P < .001). The number of iNKT cells was  significantly larger in severe AD skin lesions than in mild (P < .001) or moderate AD skin lesions (P < .05). TSLP expression increased in lesional skin (P < .001) but not in the sera of patients with AD (P = .729) compared with HC. iNKT cells expressed TSLP receptor protein and mRNA. TSLP directly activated iNKT cells to secrete IL-4 and IL-13, and the concurrent addition of dendritic cells further activated IFN-gamma expression. CONCLUSION: Increased iNKT cells activated by TSLP, especially in patients with severe AD, might play an essential role in the innate allergic immune response in AD.

Spatiotemporal expression of periostin during skin development and incisional wound healing: lessons for human fibrotic scar formation.  Zhou HM, Wang J, Elliott C, Wen W, Hamilton DW, Conway SJ.  Differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts and collagen fibrillogenesis are two processes essential for normal cutaneous development and repair, but their misregulation also underlies skin-associated fibrosis. Periostin is a matricellular protein normally expressed in adult skin, but its role in skin organogenesis, incisional wound healing and skin pathology has yet to be investigated in any depth. Using C57/BL6 mouse skin as model, we first investigated periostin protein and mRNA spatiotemporal expression and distribution during development and after incisional wounding. Secondarily we assessed whether periostin is expressed in human skin pathologies, including keloid and hypertrophic scars, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. During development, periostin is expressed in the dermis, basement membrane and hair follicles from embryonic through neonatal stages and in the dermis and hair follicle only in adult. In situ hybridization demonstrated that dermal fibroblasts and basal keratinocytes express periostin mRNA. After incisional wounding, periostin becomes re-expressed in the basement membrane within the dermal-epidermal junction at the wound edge re-establishing the embryonic deposition pattern present in the adult. Analysis of periostin expression in human pathologies demonstrated that it is over-expressed in keloid and hypertrophic scars, atopic dermatitis, but is largely absent from sites of inflammation and inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis. Furthermore, in vitro we demonstrated that periostin is a transforming growth factor beta 1 inducible gene in human dermal fibroblasts. We conclude that periostin is an important ECM  component during development, in wound healing and is strongly associated with pathological skin remodeling.SUMMARY: Periostin is a fibrogenic protein that mediates fibroblast differentiation and extracellular matrix synthesis. Here, we  show that periostin is dynamically and temporally expressed during skin development, is induced by TGF-beta1 in vitro and is significantly upregulated during wound repair as well as cutaneous pathologies.

Activation of human eosinophils and epidermal keratinocytes by Th2 cytokine IL-31: implication for the immunopathogenesis of atopic dermatitis.  Cheung PF(1), Wong CK, Ho AW, Hu S, Chen DP, Lam CW.  Author information:  (1)Department of Chemical Pathology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince  of Wales Hospital, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong.  IL-31 is a novel T(h) type 2 cytokine that can induce pruritus and dermatitis in  mice resembling human atopic dermatitis (AD). Eosinophil infiltration in skin lesions is a predominant pathological feature of AD. In the present study, we investigated the effects of IL-31 on the activation of human eosinophils and epidermal keratinocytes. Eosinophils and keratinocytes were cultured either together or separately in the presence or absence of IL-31 stimulation. IL-31 could significantly induce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6 and AD-related chemokines CXCL1, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL18 from eosinophils, via functional cell surface IL-31 receptor. Such induction was further enhanced upon  the co-culture of eosinophils and keratinocytes, in which eosinophils were the main source for releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The presence of transwell inserts in co-culture system demonstrated that the direct interaction between eosinophils and keratinocytes was required for IL-31-induced  cytokine and chemokine release. Cell surface expression of adhesion molecule CD18 on eosinophils and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 on keratinocytes was up-regulated in the co-culture, and levels were further enhanced upon IL-31 stimulation. The interaction between eosinophils and keratinocytes under IL-31 stimulation was differentially mediated through intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinases, nuclear factor-kappaB and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathways. The above findings suggest a crucial immunopathological role of IL-31 in AD through activation of eosinophils-keratinocytes system.  DOI: 10.1093/intimm/dxq027 	20410259

IL-31 is the ligand for a heterodimeric  receptor composed of a gp130-like receptor (GPL) associated with the oncostatin M receptor (OSMR). A link between IL-31 and atopic dermatitis was shown by studying the phenotype of IL-31 transgenic mice and IL-31 gene haplotypes in patients suffering from dermatitis. In this study, we generated a potent IL-31 antagonist  formed by external portions of OSMR and GPL fused with a linker. This fusion protein, OSMR-L-GPL, consisting of 720 amino acids, counteracted the binding of IL-31 to its membrane receptor complex and the subsequent signaling events involving the STATs and MAPK pathways. Neutralizing effects were found in IL-31-sensitive cell lines, including brain-derived cells and primary cultures of keratinocytes.  DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M109.049163  PMCID: PMC2865271	20335179

Sphingosylphosphorylcholine down-regulates filaggrin gene transcription through NOX5-based NADPH oxidase and cyclooxygenase-2 in human keratinocytes.  Choi H(1), Kim S, Kim HJ, Kim KM, Lee CH, Shin JH, Noh M.  Author information:  (1)Skin Research Institute, AmorePacific Corporation Research Center, Yongin, Gyeounggi-do 446-729, Republic of Korea.  Sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) mediates various inflammatory and behavioral responses in atopic dermatitis. Recent studies have shown that dysfunction of the epidermal permeability barrier itself plays a primary role in the etiology of atopic dermatitis. However, the effects of SPC on major proteins essential to the development of the epidermal permeability barrier such as filaggrin, loricrin, involucrin, keratin 1, keratin 10 and small proline-rich proteins are still unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that SPC significantly reduces filaggrin  gene transcription, implying that SPC plays a pivotal role in impairment of the epidermal permeability barrier in atopic dermatitis lesional skin. In cultured normal human keratinocytes (NHKs), SPC increases the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and up-regulates NADPH oxidase 5 (NOX5) gene transcription. SPC also stimulates prostaglandin (PG) E(2) production by increasing cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression in NHK. The effects of the prostanoid EP receptor agonists, limaprost, butaprost, and sulprostone on filaggrin gene expression in NHK suggest that the prostanoid EP2 receptor plays a significant role in the PGE(2)-mediated filaggrin down-regulation. In contrast, limaprost and butaprost do not affect NOX5 expression in NHK, implying that the NOX5-regulated ROS pathway stimulated by SPC may be upstream of the COX-2 pathway. We propose that the increase in SPC levels further aggravates dermatological symptoms of atopic dermatitis through SPC-induced down-regulation  of filaggrin in NHK.  (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Author information:  (1)Department of Veterinary Medicine, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo 183-8509, Japan. kojimail@cc.tuat.ac.jp  Pemphigus, a group of autoimmune blistering dermatoses recognized in humans and dogs, is divided into three subgroups: pemphigus vulgaris (PV), pemphigus foliaceus (PF) and paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP). Previously, we have demonstrated that circulating anti-desmoglein 3 (Dsg3) IgG in dogs with PV and PNP disrupts Dsg3-mediated keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion. The aim of this study was to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of  circulating IgG against canine Dsg3 in dogs with pemphigus. A secreted form of recombinant protein representing the entire extracellular domain of canine Dsg3 (cDsg3) was produced by baculovirus expression and used as the coated antigen in  the ELISA. The titre of anti-cDsg3 ELISA was significantly higher in canine PV (n = 14) than that in healthy dogs (n = 44) (P < 0.05). Of the canine PV and PNP sera, 11/14 (79%) canine PV sera and the canine PNP serum were positive in the anti-cDsg3 ELISA. On the other hand, 14/37 (38%) sera from canine PF and 9/18 (50%) sera from canine autoimmune subepidermal bullous dermatoses were positive in the ELISA. Circulating IgG against cDsg3 was not recognized in dogs with superficial pyoderma (n = 5), atopic dermatitis (n = 8), or in healthy dogs (n =  44). Moreover, IgG immunoreactivity against cDsg3 in all 21 sera was completely absorbed by preincubation with cDsg3. These findings altogether suggest that the  anti-cDsg3 ELISA can be used as a rapid screening test for the detection of circulating anti-Dsg3 IgG autoantibodies in canine pemphigus.

Atopic dermatitis-like disease and associated lethal myeloproliferative disorder  arise from loss of Notch signaling in the murine skin.  Dumortier A(1), Durham AD, Di Piazza M, Vauclair S, Koch U, Ferrand G, Ferrero I, Demehri S, Song LL, Farr AG, Leonard WJ, Kopan R, Miele L, Hohl D, Finke D, Radtke F.  Author information:  (1)Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL SV ISREC), Lausanne, Switzerland.  BACKGROUND: The Notch pathway is essential for proper epidermal differentiation during embryonic skin development. Moreover, skin specific loss of Notch signaling in the embryo results in skin barrier defects accompanied by a B-lymphoproliferative disease. However, much less is known about the consequences of loss of Notch signaling after birth. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To study the function of Notch signaling in the skin of adult mice, we made use of a series of conditional gene targeted mice that allow inactivation of several components of the Notch signaling pathway specifically in the skin. We demonstrate that skin-specific inactivation of Notch1 and Notch2 simultaneously, or RBP-J, induces the development of a severe form of atopic dermatitis (AD), characterized by acanthosis, spongiosis and hyperkeratosis, as well as a massive dermal infiltration of eosinophils and mast  cells. Likewise, patients suffering from AD, but not psoriasis or lichen planus,  have a marked reduction of Notch receptor expression in the skin. Loss of Notch in keratinocytes induces the production of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine deeply implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. The AD-like associated inflammation is accompanied by a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) characterized  by an increase in immature myeloid populations in the bone marrow and spleen. Transplantation studies revealed that the MPD is cell non-autonomous and caused by dramatic microenvironmental alterations. Genetic studies demontrated that G-CSF mediates the MPD as well as changes in the bone marrow microenvironment leading to osteopenia. SIGNIFICANCE: Our data demonstrate a critical role for Notch in repressing TSLP production in keratinocytes, thereby maintaining integrity of the skin and the hematopoietic system.

Author information:  (1)Division of Immunology, Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.  Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an epithelial cell-derived cytokine expressed in skin, gut, lungs, and thymus. TSLP signals via a TSLP receptor (TSLPR), a heterodimer of the IL-7 receptor alpha chain and the TSLPR chain. The  TSLPR chain is closely related to the common receptor gamma chain that is expressed on a wide range of cell types in the adaptive and innate immune system. TSLP exerts a profound influence on the polarization of dendritic cells to drive  T helper (Th) 2 cytokine production. TSLP also directly promotes T-cell proliferation in response to T-cell receptor activation and Th2 cytokine production and supports B-cell expansion and differentiation. TSLP further amplifies Th2 cytokine production by mast cells and natural killer T cells. These properties confer on TSLP a critical role in driving Th2-mediated inflammation. This role is supported by the finding that TSLP expression is upregulated in keratinocytes of atopic dermatitis skin lesions and in bronchial epithelial cells in asthma.

The role of thymic stromal lymphopoietin in allergic inflammation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Fang C(1), Siew LQ, Corrigan CJ, Ying S.  Author information:  (1)Division of Asthma, Allergy and Lung Biology, MRC and Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma, King's College London, London, UK.  Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) primes dendritic cells to promote a Th2 inflammatory response. Its action is mediated by a heterodimeric receptor which consists of the interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain and the TSLP receptor chain (TSLPR). TSLPR resembles the common gamma chain subunit utilized by many type 1 cytokine receptors. Normal epithelial cells, keratinocytes, and stromal cells constitutively express TSLP. Dendritic cells that are activated by TSLP promote the development of CD4(+) T cells into pro-inflammatory Th2 cells. TSLP thus plays a potentially important role in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation in asthma and atopic dermatitis. TSLP also has direct effects on other types of cells in the bronchial mucosa. It is over-expressed in the bronchial mucosa in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is traditionally described as a Th1-related disease, as well as severe asthma, which is traditionally described as a Th2-related disease. In this review we will discuss TSLP expression, function, and available and potential mechanisms in both allergic inflammation and COPD.  DOI: 10.1007/s00005-010-0064-3 	20143171

Author information:  (1)Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 156-756, South Korea. leecs@cau.ac.kr  Microbial products, including lipopolysaccharide, may be involved in the pathogenesis of skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis. Diarylheptanoids such as oregonin and hirsutenone have been shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect. We  investigated the effect of hirsutenone on lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory mediator production in keratinocytes in relation to the Toll-like receptor 4-mediated activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathways. Hirsutenone, dexamethasone, ERK inhibitor or Bay 11-7085 (an inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation) reduced the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of cytokines IL-1beta and IL-8, and the chemokine CCL17. Hirsutenone, ERK inhibitor or Bay 11-7085 also prevented the lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of Toll-like receptor 4, the phosphorylation of inhibitory kappaB-alpha, the activation of NF-kappaB and the expression of ERK. The results show that hirsutenone may reduce the lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of inflammatory mediators in keratinocytes by suppressing the Toll-like receptor 4 expression-mediated NF-kappaB activation that is regulated by the ERK pathway. These findings suggest that hirsutenone may exert a preventive effect against microbial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory skin diseases through inhibition of ERK pathway-mediated NF-kappaB activation.

Terhorst D(1), Kalali BN, Ollert M, Ring J, Mempel M.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.  The family of toll-like receptors (TLRs) plays a central role in the cutaneous immune defense system. To date, different TLRs have been found on several major cell populations of the skin, such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts, antigen-presenting cells, and melanocytes. Activation of TLRs leads, via different intracellular signaling pathways, to the production of pro-inflammatory stimuli, and is considered a danger signal that should transform the skin in to the functional state of defense. However, TLRs have also been implicated in tissue homeostasis and renewal. Within the group of TLRs, two types have been identified: surface-expressed TLRs, which are predominantly active against bacterial cell wall compounds; and intracellular receptors, which preferentially  recognize virus-associated pattern molecules. In addition, surface-expressed receptors trigger phagocytotic and maturation signals, while the intracellular TLRs lead to the induction of antiviral genes. Our review aims to outline the importance of TLRs in the pathogenesis of numerous skin diseases and the potential of TLR agonists as a treatment option for various skin diseases.

Langerhans cell (LC) proliferation mediates neonatal development, homeostasis, and inflammation-associated expansion of the epidermal LC network.

Author information:  (1)Centre for Molecular and Cellular Biology of Inflammation, Division of Immunobiology, Infection, and Inflammatory Diseases, King's College London, London SE1 1UL, England, UK.  Most tissues develop from stem cells and precursors that undergo differentiation  as their proliferative potential decreases. Mature differentiated cells rarely proliferate and are replaced at the end of their life by new cells derived from precursors. Langerhans cells (LCs) of the epidermis, although of myeloid origin,  were shown to renew in tissues independently from the bone marrow, suggesting the existence of a dermal or epidermal progenitor. We investigated the mechanisms involved in LC development and homeostasis. We observed that a single wave of LC  precursors was recruited in the epidermis of mice around embryonic day 18 and acquired a dendritic morphology, major histocompatibility complex II, CD11c, and  langerin expression immediately after birth. Langerin(+) cells then undergo a massive burst of proliferation between postnatal day 2 (P2) and P7, expanding their numbers by 10-20-fold. After the first week of life, we observed low-level  proliferation of langerin(+) cells within the epidermis. However, in a mouse model of atopic dermatitis (AD), a keratinocyte signal triggered increased epidermal LC proliferation. Similar findings were observed in epidermis from human patients with AD. Therefore, proliferation of differentiated resident cells represents an alternative pathway for development in the newborn, homeostasis, and expansion in adults of selected myeloid cell populations such as LCs. This mechanism may be relevant in locations where leukocyte trafficking is limited.  DOI: 10.1084/jem.20091586  PMCID: PMC2806478	19995948

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University Hospitals of Schleswig-Holstein, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany. mjensen@dermatology.uni-kiel.de  The skin provides an effective barrier between the organism and the environment,  preventing the invasion of pathogens and fending off chemical and physical assaults, as well as the unregulated loss of water and solutes. In this review we provide an overview of several components of the physical barrier, as well as how barrier function is regulated and altered in association with dermatoses. The physical barrier localized primarily in the stratum corneum (SC) and consists of  protein-enriched cells (corneocytes with cornified envelope and cytoskeletal elements, as well as corneodesmosomes) and lipid-enriched intercellular domains.  The nucleated epidermis, with its tight, gap and adherens junctions, additional desmosomes and cytoskeletal elements, also contributes to the barrier. Lipids are synthesized in the keratinocytes during epidermal differentiation and are then extruded into the extracellular domains, where they form lipid-enriched extracellular layers. The cornified cell envelope, a robust protein/lipid polymer structure, is located below the cytoplasmic membrane on the exterior of the corneocytes. Ceramides A and B, forming the backbone for the subsequent addition  of free ceramides, free fatty acids and cholesterol in the SC, are covalently bound to cornified envelope proteins. Filaggrin is cross-linked to the cornified  envelope and aggregates keratin filaments into macrofibrils. Cytokines, cAMP and  calcium influence the formation and maintenance of barrier function. Changes in lipid composition and epidermal differentiation lead to a disturbed skin barrier, which allows the entry of environmental allergens, immunological reaction and inflammation in atopic dermatitis. A disturbed skin barrier is an important component in the pathogenesis of contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis.  	19907407

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the role of EGFR in the regulation of keratinocyte GM-CSF expression. In cultured human keratinocytes, proinflammatory  cytokines synergized with TGF-alpha to induce GM-CSF expression. Accordingly, high epidermal levels of EGFR activation are associated with enhanced expression  of GM-CSF in lesional skin of patients with psoriasis or allergic contact dermatitis. In cultured keratinocytes, pharmacological inhibition of EGFR activity reduced GM-CSF promoter transactivation, whereas genetic inhibition of AP-1 reduced expression of GM-CSF. Furthermore, EGFR activation enhanced TNF-alpha-induced c-Jun phosphorylation and DNA binding, whereas c-Jun silencing  reduced GM-CSF expression. Using two different mouse models, we showed that the lack of a functional EGFR pathway was associated with reduced cytokine-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK1/2, c-Jun and reduced keratinocyte-derived GM-CSF  expression both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the analysis of GM-CSF expression  in the skin of cancer patients treated with anti EGFR drugs showed an association between ERK activity, c-Jun phosphorylation, and epidermal GM-CSF expression. These data demonstrate that the EGFR pathway is critical for the upregulation of  keratinocyte GM-CSF expression under conditions of cytokine stimulation.  DOI: 10.1038/jid.2009.336 	19890352

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, D-24105, Kiel, Germany. umeyerhoffert@dermatology.uni-kiel.de  The skin protects us from water loss and mechanical damage. The surface-exposed epidermis, a self-renewing stratified squamous epithelium composed of several layers of keratinocytes, is most important in the barrier defense against these challenges. Endogenous and exogenous proteases such as kallikreins, matriptase, caspases, cathepsins, and proteases derived from microorganisms are important in  the desquamation process of the stratum corneum and are able to activate and inactivate defense molecules in human epidermis. Protease inhibitors such as like LEKTI, elafin, SLPI, SERPINs, and cystatins regulate their proteolytic activity and contribute to the integrity and protective barrier function of the skin. Changes in the proteolytic balance of the skin can result in inflammation, which  leads to the typical clinical signs of redness, scaling, and itching. This review summarizes the current knowledge of how proteases, their inhibitors, and their target proteins, including filaggrin, protease-activated receptors, and corneodesmosin, contribute to the pathophysiology of inflammation of the skin and highlight their role in common inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, rosacea, and psoriasis.

Injury downregulates the expression of the human cathelicidin protein hCAP18/LL-37 in atopic dermatitis.  Mallbris L(1), Carlén L, Wei T, Heilborn J, Nilsson MF, Granath F, Ståhle M.  Author information:  (1)Unit of Dermatology, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.  Reduced production of antimicrobial peptides was proposed to contribute to susceptibility for skin infections in atopic dermatitis (AD). Focusing on the human cathelicidin protein, hCAP18, the aim of the present study was to explore whether reduced hCAP18 expression is a constitutive trait in AD and if established inducers affect the expression of hCAP18 in the skin of AD. First, we compared levels of hCAP18 mRNA between lesional skin in AD and psoriasis and verified significantly lower expression of hCAP18 mRNA in AD. In non-lesional skin, however, there was no difference between AD, psoriasis and healthy, indicating that there is no constitutive defect in the production of hCAP18 in AD patients. In healthy skin, hCAP18 was reported to be rapidly induced following wounding and here we verified this pattern in healthy controls and in psoriasis.  In AD lesions, however, the expression of hCAP18 mRNA was markedly suppressed following wounding. Obviously, the inflammation in AD lesions neutralizes the expected induction of hCAP18 and even induces suppression. Notably, the mechanism to upregulate hCAP18 following vitamin D treatment was functional in lesional as  well as in non-lesional AD indicating that the CAMP gene is normally regulated in this respect. In addition, cultured primary keratinocytes from non-lesional skin  of psoriasis, AD and healthy skin, upregulated hCAP18mRNA following treatment with vitamin D. Itching is a hallmark of AD and scratching inevitably injures the skin. Failure to upregulate hCAP18 in eczema following injury is likely to affect antimicrobial protection and tissue repair in AD.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Jichi Medical University, Japan. mkomine12@jichi.ac.jp  Atopic dermatitis frequently accompanies bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, and allergic conjunctivitis, the pathogenesis of which has frequently focused on the  immunological aspects; however, skin eruption in atopic dermatitis occurs mainly  in the epidermis, whose barrier function and cytokine expression have been revealed to be abnormal. In addition, the epidermis contains Langerhans cells, antigen-presenting cells, which could be considered the sentinel of the immune system. Some atopic dermatitis patients have been revealed to have mutations or SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) in the filaggrin gene, which affect the epidermal barrier function. Proteinases in the epidermis are of importance in maintaining the epidermal barrier, abnormalities of which have been reported in atopic dermatitis. Abnormalities of various cytokines and chemokines produced by  keratinocytes have also been reported. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) produced by keratinocytes has recently been a focus in atopic dermatitis. Adrenergic/cholinergic responses in the epidermis could also influence the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis. Considering epidermal keratinocytes as a trigger of immune abnormalities, not only as a peripheral effector, would be important to further disclose the pathogenesis of this enigmatic disorder.  	19609063

To demonstrate this postulation, we alternatively evaluated whether the genes of interest in the meta-analysis can be regulated by T-helper (Th) cell cytokines in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK). We found that MAP17 was significantly up-regulated in response to interferon-gamma, interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-6, IL-17A or IL-22 in NHEK. Interestingly, MAP17 was originally reported to interact with PDZK1; in turn, the PDZK1 gene is localized within the atopic dermatitis-linked region on human chromosome 1q21. In an attempt to evaluate whether MAP17 regulates the expression of cornified envelope-associated genes at  the 1q21 locus, such as filaggrin, loricrin and involucrin, we found that the over-expression of MAP17 in HaCaT keratinocytes significantly decreased the expression of filaggrin. Taken together, the Th cell cytokine-induced up-regulation of MAP17 expression may be linked to the down-regulation of filaggrin in NHEK, which may be associated with the abnormal epidermal differentiation observed in the dermatological diseases.

Inhibition of S100A11 gene expression impairs keratinocyte response against vaccinia virus through downregulation of the IL-10 receptor 2 chain.  Bin L(1), Howell MD, Kim BE, Hall CF, Streib JE, Leung DY.  Author information:  (1)Department of Pediatrics, National Jewish Health, Denver, Colo 80206, USA.  BACKGROUND: The mechanism that predisposes patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) to disseminated vaccinia viral (VV) skin infection after smallpox vaccination is  unknown. We have demonstrated that expression of S100A11, a calcium-binding protein involved in keratinocyte differentiation, is downregulated in AD. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether inhibiting expression of S100A11 increased VV  replication in human keratinocytes and the mechanism by which S100A11 affects the innate immune response of keratinocytes. METHODS: Small interfering RNA duplexes were used to reduce gene expression of S100A11 in keratinocytes. VV replication was evaluated by real-time PCR and viral plaque assay. VV cytopathic effect was assessed by crystal violet staining. Affymetrix GeneChip assay was used to compare gene expression profiles. Real time PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry staining assay were used to evaluate gene expression in keratinocytes and AD skin biopsies. RESULTS: Keratinocytes with deficient S100A11 expression supported increased VV replication and manifested augmented VV cytopathic effects. Gene microarray analysis revealed that the IL-10 receptor 2 chain (IL-10R2), which binds IFN-lambdas, was downregulated by 2.26-fold in S100A11-silenced keratinocytes. IL-10R2 expression was found to be decreased in skin biopsies from patients with  acute AD (mean, 25.21 +/- 5.25; n = 20) compared with skin from normal healthy subjects (mean, 137.1 +/- 34.46; n = 19; P < .01). Furthermore, deficient S100A11 gene expression significantly impaired IL-29 (IFN-lambda1) responsiveness (2' 5'-oligoadenylate synthetase and Myxovirus [influenza virus] resistance induction) and its anti-VV effects in keratinocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of S100A11 gene expression impairs the ability of keratinocytes to control VV replication via downregulation of IFN-lambda receptor IL-10R2.

Mite serine protease activates protease-activated receptor-2 and induces cytokine release in human keratinocytes.  Kato T(1), Takai T, Fujimura T, Matsuoka H, Ogawa T, Murayama K, Ishii A, Ikeda S, Okumura K, Ogawa H.  Author information:  (1)Atopy Research Center, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.  BACKGROUND: House dust mites produce serine and cysteine proteases. Mite-derived  proteases have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of allergies; however, whether mite-derived serine protease activity can stimulate keratinocytes remains unknown. METHODS: We examined the activation of primary human keratinocytes by serine protease-rich extract of whole mite culture and compared with that by recombinant group 1 allergens (rDer f 1 and rDer p 1), which exclusively exhibit cysteine protease activity. RESULTS: Protease activity of whole mite culture extract (WCE), rDer f 1 and rDer p 1 induced the release of IL-8 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Protease activity of WCEs induced a significant upregulation of their mRNA expression but rDer f 1 had much less effect. Protease activity of the WCE stimulated intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization but rDer f 1 and rDer p 1 did not. The mobilization induced by agonists for the human protease-activated receptor (PAR)-2, an agonist peptide or trypsin, was diminished by pre-incubation of keratinocytes with WCE. rDer f 1 inefficiently cleaved a synthetic N-terminal peptide of PAR-2 at different sites from trypsin, but the resultant peptides did  not stimulate the release of interleukin-8. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that mite-derived serine protease activity may contribute to the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis by activating keratinocytes via PAR-2 activation but cysteine protease activity of Der f 1 and Der p 1 acts via another mechanism.

Expression of the vanin gene family in normal and inflamed human skin: induction  by proinflammatory cytokines.  Jansen PA(1), Kamsteeg M, Rodijk-Olthuis D, van Vlijmen-Willems IM, de Jongh GJ,  Bergers M, Tjabringa GS, Zeeuwen PL, Schalkwijk J.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology and Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.  The vanin gene family encodes secreted and membrane-bound ectoenzymes that convert pantetheine into pantothenic acid and cysteamine. Recent studies in a mouse colitis model indicated that vanin-1 has proinflammatory activity and suggest that pantetheinases are potential therapeutic targets in inflammatory diseases. In a microarray analysis of epidermal gene expression of psoriasis and  atopic dermatitis lesions, we identified vanin-3 as the gene showing the highest  differential expression of all annotated genes that we studied (19-fold upregulation in psoriasis). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis confirmed the microarray data on vanin-3 and showed similar induction of vanin-1, but not of vanin-2, in psoriatic epidermis. Immunohistochemistry showed that vanin-3 is expressed in the differentiated epidermal layers. Using submerged and organotypic keratinocyte cultures, we found that vanin-1 and vanin-3 are induced at the mRNA  and protein level by psoriasis-associated proinflammatory cytokines (Th17/Th1) but not by Th2 cytokines. We hypothesize that increased levels of pantetheinase activity are part of the inflammatory-regenerative epidermal differentiation program, and may contribute to the phenotype observed in psoriasis.

Author information:  (1)Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, California 92161, USA.  Comment in     J Invest Dermatol. 2009 Sep;129(9):2088-90.  Innate immune responses involve the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs),  chemokines, and cytokines. We report here the identification of B-cell leukemia (Bcl)-3 as a modulator of innate immune signaling in keratinocytes. In this study, it is shown that Bcl-3 is inducible by the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 and is overexpressed in lesional skin of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients. Bcl-3 was shown to be important to cutaneous innate immune responses as silencing of Bcl-3 by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) reversed the downregulatory effect of IL-4 on the HBD3 expression. Bcl-3 silencing enhanced vitamin D3 (1,25D3)-induced gene expression of cathelicidin AMP in keratinocytes, suggesting a negative regulatory function on cathelicidin transcription. Furthermore, 1,25D3 suppressed Bcl-3 expression in vitro and in vivo. This study identified Bcl-3 as an important modulator of cutaneous innate immune responses and its possible therapeutic role  in AD.  DOI: 10.1038/jid.2009.49  PMCID: PMC2758924	19282837

Involvement of Tryptase and Proteinase-Activated Receptor-2 in Spontaneous Itch-Associated Response in Mice With Atopy-like Dermatitis.  Tsujii K(1), Andoh T, Ui H, Lee JB, Kuraishi Y.  Author information:  (1)Department of Applied Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medical and Pharmaceutical Science, University of Toyama, Japan.  This study investigated the involvement of tryptase and proteinase-activated receptor (PAR) subtypes in spontaneous scratching, an itch-associated behavior, in NC mice. This strain of mice showed chronic atopy-like dermatitis and severe spontaneous scratching, when kept a long time in a conventional environment. The  trypsin-like serine proteinase inhibitor nafamostat mesilate (1 - 10 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited spontaneous scratching in mice with dermatitis. The activity of tryptase was increased in the lesional skin, which was inhibited by nafamostat at a dose inhibiting spontaneous scratching. Enzyme histochemistry revealed the marked increase of toluidine blue-stained cells, probably mast cells, with tryptase activity in the dermis of the lesional skin. Intravenous injection of anti-PAR(2) antibody suppressed spontaneous scratching of mice with  dermatitis. Intradermal injection of the PAR(2)-activating peptide SLIGRL-NH(2),  but not PAR(1), (3), (4)-activating peptides, elicited scratching at doses of 10  - 100 nmol/site in healthy mice. PAR(2)-immunoreactivity was observed in the epidermal keratinocytes in healthy and dermatitis mice. These results suggest that PAR(2) and serine proteinase(s), mainly tryptase, are involved in the itch of chronic dermatitis.  	19270428

IL-17 in atopic eczema: linking allergen-specific adaptive and microbial-triggered innate immune response.  Eyerich K(1), Pennino D, Scarponi C, Foerster S, Nasorri F, Behrendt H, Ring J, Traidl-Hoffmann C, Albanesi C, Cavani A.  Author information:  (1)Laboratory of Immunology, IDI-IRCCS, Rome, Italy. kilian.eyerich@gmx.de  BACKGROUND: Patients with atopic eczema (AE) regularly experience colonization with Staphylococcus aureus that is directly correlated with the severity of eczema. Recent studies show that an impaired IL-17 immune response results in diseases associated with chronic skin infections. OBJECTIVE: We sought to elucidate the effect of IL-17 on antimicrobial immune responses in AE skin. METHODS: T cells infiltrating atopy patch test (APT) reactions were characterized for IL-17 secretion to varying stimuli. IL-17-dependent induction of the antimicrobial peptide human beta-defensin 2 (HBD-2) in keratinocytes was investigated. RESULTS: Approximately 10% of APT-infiltrating T cells secreted IL-17 after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin stimulation. Among these, 33% belonged to the newly characterized subtype T(H)2/IL-17. Despite the capacity to  secrete IL-17, specific T-cell clones released only low amounts of IL-17 on cognate allergen stimulation, whereas IL-4, IFN-gamma, or both were efficiently induced. IL-17 secretion was not enhanced by IL-23, IL-1 beta, or IL-6 but was enhanced by the S aureus-derived superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B. Both  healthy and AE keratinocytes upregulated HBD-2 in response to IL-17, but coexpressed IL-4/IL-13 partially inhibited this effect. In vivo, additional application of staphylococcal enterotoxin B induced IL-17 in APT reactions, whereas IL-4, IFN-gamma, and IL-10 were marginally regulated. Induced IL-17 upregulated HBD-2 in human keratinocytes in vivo. CONCLUSION: IL-17-capable T cells, in particular T(H)2/IL-17 cells, infiltrate acute AE reactions. Although IL-17 secretion by specific T cells is tightly regulated, it can be triggered by bacteria-derived superantigens. The ineffective IL-17-dependent upregulation of HBD-2 in patients with AE is due to a partial inhibition by the type 2 microenvironment, which could partially explain why patients with AE do not clear S aureus.

Cytokine milieu modulates release of thymic stromal lymphopoietin from human keratinocytes stimulated with double-stranded RNA.  Kinoshita H(1), Takai T, Le TA, Kamijo S, Wang XL, Ushio H, Hara M, Kawasaki J, Vu AT, Ogawa T, Gunawan H, Ikeda S, Okumura K, Ogawa H.  Author information:  (1)Atopy (Allergy) Research Center, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.  Comment in     J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2009 Oct;124(4):862-4; author reply 864-5.  BACKGROUND: Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) plays a key role in allergic diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and asthma. TSLP is highly expressed by  keratinocytes in skin lesions of patients with AD, but environmental triggers for its release from keratinocytes with endogenous factors are not well understood. Patients with AD, in whom allergic sensitization is already established, are susceptible to viral dissemination. OBJECTIVES: We investigated TSLP's release from primary human keratinocytes stimulated with a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 ligand, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, which mimics viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and its modulation by cytokines. METHODS: Primary human keratinocytes were stimulated with TLR ligands, cytokines, or both. TSLP released into culture supernatants was measured by means of ELISA. RESULTS: Stimulation of keratinocytes with dsRNA induced release of TSLP and upregulated gene expression of TSLP and other cytokines and chemokines. The release of TSLP was enhanced by the addition of IL-4, IL-13, and/or TNF-alpha. With or without the T(H)2/TNF cytokines, the dsRNA-induced release of TSLP was upregulated by IFN-alpha and IFN-beta and suppressed by IFN-gamma, TGF-beta, or IL-17. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of the TLR3 ligand on keratinocytes suggests contribution of viral dsRNA to skin inflammations under the influence of a cytokine milieu. The results imply that viral dsRNA and a T(H)2 cytokine milieu might promote T(H)2-type inflammation through an induction of TSLP expression, suggesting that  a vicious cycle exists between AD with T(H)2-type inflammation and viral infections and a possible blockade of this cycle by other cytokine milieus provided by cells, such as T(H)1, regulatory T, and T(H)17 cells.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University Hospitals of Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany. eproksch@dermatology.uni-kiel.de  The skin forms an effective barrier between the organism and the environment preventing invasion of pathogens and fending off chemical and physical assaults,  as well as the unregulated loss of water and solutes. In this review we provide an overview of several components of the physical barrier, explaining how barrier function is regulated and altered in dermatoses. The physical barrier is mainly localized in the stratum corneum (SC) and consists of protein-enriched cells (corneocytes with cornified envelope and cytoskeletal elements, as well as corneodesmosomes) and lipid-enriched intercellular domains. The nucleated epidermis also contributes to the barrier through tight, gap and adherens junctions, as well as through desmosomes and cytoskeletal elements. During epidermal differentiation lipids are synthesized in the keratinocytes and extruded into the extracellular domains, where they form extracellular lipid-enriched layers. The cornified cell envelope, a tough protein/lipid polymer structure, resides below the cytoplasmic membrane on the exterior of the corneocytes. Ceramides A and B are covalently bound to cornified envelope proteins and form the backbone for the subsequent addition of free ceramides, free fatty acids and cholesterol in the SC. Filaggrin is cross-linked to the cornified envelope and aggregates keratin filaments into macrofibrils. Formation  and maintenance of barrier function is influenced by cytokines, 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate and calcium. Changes in epidermal differentiation and lipid composition lead to a disturbed skin barrier, which allows the entry of environmental allergens, immunological reaction and inflammation in atopic dermatitis. A disturbed skin barrier is important for the pathogenesis of contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.  	19043850

Cytokine-induced CEACAM1 expression on keratinocytes is characteristic for psoriatic skin and contributes to a prolonged lifespan of neutrophils.  Rahmoun M(1), Molès JP, Pedretti N, Mathieu M, Fremaux I, Raison-Peyron N, Lecron JC, Yssel H, Pène J.  Author information:  (1)Inserm, U844, Montpellier, France.  Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cellular adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is a cell-surface glycoprotein, belonging to the carcinoembryonic antigen family, expressed by human neutrophils, epithelial cells, activated T and NK cells. CEACAM1 is expressed as a cell-surface molecule with different isoforms or can be secreted as a soluble protein. Here, we show that keratinocytes in the outer epidermal layer of psoriatic skin express CEACAM1, unlike those in healthy skin or in cutaneous lesions of patients with atopic or nummular dermatitis. Stimulation of primary human keratinocytes or in vitro reconstituted epidermis with culture supernatants of activated psoriatic lesion-infiltrating T cells, IFN-gamma or oncostatin M, but not IL-17, induced the expression of transcripts for the CEACAM1-long and -short isoforms and cell-surface CEACAM1, whereas soluble CEACAM1 was not produced. The uppermost layers of the epidermis in psoriatic lesions also contain neutrophils, a cell type with inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Coculture of CEACAM1-expressing keratinocytes or CHO transfectants with neutrophils delayed spontaneous apoptosis of the latter cells. These results show that cytokine-induced cell-surface expression of CEACAM1 by keratinocytes in the context of a psoriatic environment might contribute to the persistence of neutrophils and thus to ongoing inflammation and the decreased propensity for skin infection, typical for patients with psoriasis.

Author information:  (1)Institute of Pharmacology, Biocenter Niederursel, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Max-von-Laue-Strasse 9, 60439 Frankfurt, Germany.  The protective epithelial barrier in our skin undergoes constant regulation, whereby the balance between differentiation and proliferation of keratinocytes plays a major role. Impaired keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation are key elements in the pathophysiology of several important dermatological diseases, including atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Ca(2+) influx plays an essential role  in this process presumably mediated by different transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. However, investigating their individual role was hampered by the  lack of specific stimulators or inhibitors. Because we have recently identified hyperforin as a specific TRPC6 activator, we investigated the contribution of TRPC6 to keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation. Like the endogenous differentiation stimulus high extracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](o)), hyperforin triggers differentiation in HaCaT cells and in primary cultures of human keratinocytes by inducing Ca(2+) influx via TRPC6 channels and additional inhibition of proliferation. Knocking down TRPC6 channels prevents the induction  of Ca(2+)- and hyperforin-induced differentiation. Importantly, TRPC6 activation  is sufficient to induce keratinocyte differentiation similar to the physiological stimulus [Ca(2+)](o). Therefore, TRPC6 activation by hyperforin may represent a new innovative therapeutic strategy in skin disorders characterized by altered keratinocyte differentiation.

Lee HJ(1), Kwon YS, Park CO, Oh SH, Lee JH, Wu WH, Chang NS, Lee MG, Lee KH.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.  Recent evidence suggests that crosstalk between mast cells, nerves and keratinocytes might be involved in the exacerbation of inflammatory conditions by stress, but the mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), which activates the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis under stress, also has pro-inflammatory  peripheral effects. However, there have been no reports about CRF receptor expression and the functional role of CRF in the dendritic cell (DC), which is considered to be the link between allergen uptake and the clinical manifestations of allergic diseases, such as atopic dermatitis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of CRF receptors and the functional role of CRF in the monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) of atopic dermatitis patients and non-atopic healthy controls. In this study, mRNAs for CRF-R1alpha and 1beta, as well as the CRF-R1 protein, were detected in MoDCs. CRF-R2alpha (but not R2beta or R2gamma) mRNA and the CRF-R2 protein were present in MoDCs. Exposure of DCs to CRF resulted in a decrease of IL-18 in both atopic dermatitis patients and non-atopic healthy controls. However, CRF did not alter the expression of IL-6, CCL17, CCL18, and CCL22. Therefore, our results demonstrate that CRF could modulate immune responses by acting directly upon DCs.  DOI: 10.1111/j.1600-0625.2008.00781.x 	18803662

Particularly, we outline the role of different T-helper cell subsets (i.e. Th-1, Th-2, T-regulatory and Th-17 cells) and their distinct influence on the cutaneous inflammatory reaction at different stages of the disease. Eczema is characterized by epidermal inflammation and thus T-cell/ker -  atinocyte interactions are of particular relevance in this condition. Alterations in innate and adaptive immunity involving T cells result in susceptibility to skin infections and in hyperreactivity reactions to environmental stimuli which in turn determine the course and severity of atopic dermatitis.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany. birgit.schittek@med.uni-tuebingen.de  Antimicrobial peptides or proteins (AMPs) represent an ancient and efficient innate defense mechanism which protects interfaces from infection with pathogenic microorganisms. In human skin AMPs are produced mainly by keratinocytes, neutrophils, sebocytes or sweat glands and are either expressed constitutively or after an inflammatory stimulus. In several human skin diseases there is an inverse correlation between severity of the disease and the level of AMP production. Skin lesions of patients with atopic dermatitis show a diminished expression of the beta-defensins and the cathelicidin LL-37. Furthermore, these patients have a reduced amount of the AMP dermcidin in their sweat which correlates with an impaired innate defense of human skin in vivo. In addition, decreased levels of AMPs are associated with burns and chronic wounds. In contrast, overexpression of AMPs can lead to increased protection against skin infections as seen in patients with psoriasis and rosacea, inflammatory skin-diseases which rarely result in superinfection. In other skin diseases, e.g. in patients with acne vulgaris, increased levels of AMPs are often found in inflamed or infected skin areas indicating a role of these peptides in the protection from infection. These data indicate that AMPs have a therapeutical potential as topical anti-infectives in several skin diseases. The broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, the low incidence of bacterial resistance and their function as immunomodulatory agents are attractive features of AMPs for their clinical use.  	18782030

Enhanced CCL26 production by IL-4 through IFN-gamma-induced upregulation of type  1 IL-4 receptor in keratinocytes.  Nishi N(1), Yamamoto S, Ou W, Muro E, Inada Y, Hamasaki Y.  Author information:  (1)Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, 5-1-1 Nabeshima, Saga 849-8501, Japan.  A Th2 cytokine, IL-4, induces various chemokines from epidermal keratinocytes which play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis. In contrast, the role of IFN-gamma, a Th1 cytokine, on eosinophilic skin inflammation is unclear. This study investigated the effects of IFN-gamma on IL-4-induced production of eotaxin-3/CCL26, a potent chemoattractant to eosinophils, in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK). When the cells were  stimulated with IL-4 and IFN-gamma simultaneously, IL-4-induced CCL26 production  was attenuated. In contrast, prior stimulation with IFN-gamma enhanced IL-4-induced CCL26 production. NHEK constitutively expressed type 1 IL-4 receptor, and expression at the cell surface was upregulated by stimulation with  IFN-gamma. This upregulation resulted in an enhanced IL-4-mediated cellular signal. These results indicate that IFN-gamma has opposite effects on IL-4-induced CCL26 production in NHEK depending on the time of exposure. Thus, changes in IL-4R expression by IFN-gamma might modulate eosinophilic skin inflammation.  DOI: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.08.136 	18774776

Author information:  (1)The United Graduate School of Veterinary Sciences, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan.  Epidermal keratinocytes have the potential to produce inflammatory mediators that are considered to play an important role in skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD). Thus, cell lines of canine epidermal keratinocytes are useful for studying the biological reactivity of keratinocytes in vitro. However, there  has been no report on properly analyzing the phenotype of canine keratinocyte cell lines. In this work, we performed phenotypic analysis of CPEK, which was derived from the epidermis of an adult dog in order to examine the phenotypic similarity with epidermal keratinocytes. The present findings indicated that CPEK cells expressed markers for epidermal keratinocytes including cytokeratin 14, alpha6 integrin and PCNA.

The antimicrobial protein psoriasin (S100A7) is upregulated in atopic dermatitis  and after experimental skin barrier disruption.  Gläser R(1), Meyer-Hoffert U, Harder J, Cordes J, Wittersheim M, Kobliakova J, Fölster-Holst R, Proksch E, Schröder JM, Schwarz T.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Germany. rglaeser@dermatology.uni-kiel.de  The innate defense of the skin against microbial threats is influenced by antimicrobial proteins (AMP). Staphylococcus aureus often colonizes the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). This was explained by diminished expression of AMP including cathelicidin/LL-37, human beta-defensins-2 and -3, and dermcidin. The S100-protein psoriasin is an additional keratinocyte-derived AMP that preferentially kills E. coli. As E. coli infections are not observed in atopic skin we investigated the functional role of psoriasin in AD patients. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated enhanced epidermal psoriasin expression in AD.  An up to 1500-fold increase in secreted psoriasin was detected by ELISA in vivo on the surface of AD skin compared to healthy control skin. Surprisingly, tumor necrosis factor-alpha-enhanced psoriasin release in primary keratinocytes was inhibited by the Th2-cytokines IL-4 and -13, whereas IL-17 and -22 induced psoriasin. Epidermal barrier disruption significantly enhanced psoriasin expression as demonstrated by tape stripping in healthy volunteers. The upregulation of psoriasin in AD maybe induced by the disrupted skin barrier offering a possible explanation why these patients do not suffer from skin infections with E. coli. This indicates that the antimicrobial response in AD is  not generally impaired, but greatly differs according to the type of AMP produced by the skin.  DOI: 10.1038/jid.2008.268 	18754038

He R(1), Oyoshi MK, Garibyan L, Kumar L, Ziegler SF, Geha RS.  Author information:  (1)Division of Immunology, Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.  Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine expressed by epithelial cells,  including keratinocytes, and is important in allergic inflammation. Allergic skin inflammation elicited by epicutaneous immunization of mice with ovalbumin (OVA),  a potential model of atopic dermatitis, was severely impaired in TSLPR(-/-) mice, as evidenced by decreased infiltration of eosinophils and decreased local expression of T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines. However, secretion of Th2 cytokines by  splenocytes from epicutaneous sensitized TSLPR(-/-) mice in response to OVA was normal. Skin dendritic cells from TSLPR(-/-) mice were normal in their ability to migrate to draining lymph nodes, express activation markers, and induce proliferation and Th2 cytokine production by naïve T cells. CD4(+) T cells from TSLPR(-/-) mice expressed the skin homing receptor E-selectin ligand normally, and homed to the skin normally, but failed to transfer allergic skin inflammation to WT recipients. TSLP enhanced Th2 cytokine secretion in vitro by targeting TSLPR on antigen specific T cells. Intradermal injection of anti-TSLP blocked the development of allergic skin inflammation after cutaneous antigen challenge of OVA immunized WT mice. These findings suggest that TSLP is essential for antigen  driven Th2 cytokine secretion by skin infiltrating effector T cells and could be  a therapeutic target in allergic skin inflammation.

Reduced expression of nicotinic alpha subunits 3, 7, 9 and 10 in lesional and nonlesional atopic dermatitis skin but enhanced expression of alpha subunits 3 and 5 in mast cells.

Author information:  (1)Institute for Anatomy and Cell Biology, and Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen, Germany.  BACKGROUND: The skin cholinergic signalling system is modulated in atopic dermatitis (AD). OBJECTIVES: To investigate of the role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the pathogenesis of AD. METHODS: We investigated the expression and localization of nAChR alpha subunits  in AD by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry of biopsies from lesional and nonlesional areas of AD skin and of skin biopsies from healthy control persons. RESULTS: Our data demonstrate the presence of mRNA and protein of the nAChR alpha subunits 3, 5, 7, 9 and 10 in keratinocytes and mast cells in healthy and AD skin. Expression of the alpha subunits 3, 7, 9 and 10 was generally reduced in the skin of patients with AD whereas mast cells in AD but not in healthy skin showed alpha3 and alpha5 subunit immunoreactivity. Differences in the subunit mRNA levels between lesional and nonlesional skin were obtained for the alpha subunits 3, 9 and 10 with higher levels of alpha3 but lower levels of alpha10 subunit mRNA in lesional areas. No differences in the expression of the alpha subunits was found between the groups of extrinsic, intrinsic or mixed AD types,  between genders and between smokers and nonsmokers. CONCLUSIONS: This supports the idea that the cholinergic system is dysregulated independently from inflammation in AD and that inflammation further modulates individual nAChR subunits.

Song X(1), Xu A, Pan W, Wallin B, Kivlin R, Lu S, Cao C, Bi Z, Wan Y.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, the Third Hospital of Hangzhou, Hangzhou, PR China.  The most common adverse effects that are related to all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) treatment are irritation and dryness of the skin. atRA therapy is reported to impair barrier function as achieved by trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Treatment with nicotinamide prior to initiation of atRA therapy provides additional barrier protection and thus reduces susceptibility of retinoic acid. Our previous studies showed that atRA upregulates aquaporin 3 (AQP3) in cultured  human skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Others have demonstrated that in atopic dermatitis, overexpression of AQP3 is linked to elevated TEWL and that nicotinamide treatment reduces skin TEWL. In this study, we observed that while atRA upregulates AQP3 expression in cultured human skin keratinocytes (HaCaT cells), nicotinamide attenuates the effect of atRA in a concentration-dependent manner. atRA treatment induces EGFR and ERK activation. PD153035, an EGFR inhibitor, and U0126, an ERK inhibitor, inhibit atRA-induced upregulation of AQP3. Nicotinamide also inhibits atRA-induced activation of EGFR/ERK signal transduction and decreases water permeability by downregulating AQP3 expression.  Collectively, our results indicate that the effect of atRA on AQP3 expression is  at least partly mediated by EGFR/ERK signaling in cultured human skin keratinocytes. Nicotinamide attenuates atRA-induced AQP3 expression through inhibition of EGFR/ERK signal transduction and eventually decreases water permeability and water loss. Our study provides insights into the molecular mechanism through which nicotinamide reverses the side effects of dryness in human skin after treatment with atRA.  	18636178

Defective killing of Staphylococcus aureus in atopic dermatitis is associated with reduced mobilization of human beta-defensin-3.  Kisich KO(1), Carspecken CW, Fiéve S, Boguniewicz M, Leung DY.  Author information:  (1)Division of Allergy/Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver, Colo 80206, USA.  BACKGROUND: Individuals with atopic dermatitis (AD) have frequent colonization and infection with Staphylococcus aureus. Rapid elimination of S. aureus depends  on constitutive synthesis and mobilization of human beta-defensin-3 (HBD-3). OBJECTIVE: To determine whether keratinocytes in AD, compared with normal, skin are less able to kill S. aureus rapidly, and to assess the potential role that abnormally low mobilization of HBD-3 onto S. aureus has in this process. METHODS: Skin samples from 10 normal individuals and 10 patients with AD were compared for synthesis and mobilization of HBD-3 onto surface-associated S. aureus. Furthermore, keratinocytes from 10 individuals were studied for the effects of T(H)2 cytokines on the ability of the cells to synthesize and mobilize HBD-3, and to kill S. aureus. RESULTS: Keratinocytes in skin biopsies from subjects with AD were defective in killing S. aureus relative to normal individuals (P < .001). The constitutive levels of HBD-3 in the epidermal keratinocytes were similar between normal individuals and those with AD. However, the cells of patients with AD were unable to mobilize HBD-3 efficiently to kill S. aureus. Physiologic Ca(++) was essential for development of normal HBD-3 levels by cultured human keratinocytes. Mobilization of HBD-3 and the ability to kill S. aureus were significantly (P < .05) inhibited by IL-4 and IL-13. Antagonism of IL-4/10/13 with antibodies significantly (P < .01) improved mobilization of HBD-3 onto the surface of S. aureus by skin from patients with AD. CONCLUSION: Patients with AD have problems with S. aureus skin infection. This is a result of increased levels of T(H)2 cytokines, which inhibit keratinocyte mobilization of HBD-3.

Altrichter S(1), Kriehuber E, Moser J, Valenta R, Kopp T, Stingl G.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Division of Immunology, Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.  Previous studies have shown that sera of patients with severe atopic dermatitis (AD) contain IgE specific for self-proteins, supporting the hypothesis of autoreactivity as a pathogenic factor in AD. In this study, we screened a large panel of AD patients (n=192) by western blotting (WB) for IgE reactivity not only against the human epithelial cell line A431 but also against primary keratinocytes (KCs). To investigate autoantigenic cell structures in detail, normal human skin and primary KCs were incubated with sera from both WB-reactive  patients and, for control purposes, healthy individuals, and analyzed by immunohistology, confocal laser microscopy, and flow cytometry. Our analysis revealed that 28% of AD patients, but not healthy individuals, display serum IgE  autoreactivity by WB analysis. The individual IgE reaction patterns of the sera pointed to the existence of unique as well as common specificities against epidermal or A431-derived proteins. Immunostainings identified cytoplasmic and, occasionally, also cell membrane-associated moieties as targets for autoreactive  IgE antibodies. Interestingly, in certain autoreactive patients, the surface-staining pattern was accentuated at cellular contact sites. We conclude that IgE autoreactivity is common, particularly among severe AD patients, and that non-transformed primary cells are needed for characterization of the entire  spectrum of IgE-defined autoantigens.

Pan-neurotrophin receptor p75NTR expression is strongly induced in lesional atopic mast cells.  Fischer TC(1), Lauenstein HD, Serowka F, Pilzner C, Groneberg DA, Welker P.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Free University and Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.  BACKGROUND: Neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor or brain-derived neurotrophic factor influence neuronal proliferation and differentiation via the  low-affinity pan-neurotrophin receptor p75NTR that may play a pivotal role in linking the immune with the nervous system. Because the precise regulation of p75NTR gene transcription in mast cells under states of allergic inflammation has not been investigated in detail so far, the present studies assessed the gene regulation and expression of this receptor. METHODS: Transcriptional expression of p75NTR in human skin was studied in isolated cutaneous cells by means of RT-PCR. In situ lesional mast cell p75NTR expression was analysed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The p75NTR mRNA expression was found in isolated human skin mast cells and keratinocytes. Lower mRNA levels were present in fibroblasts and melanocytes  but no transcripts were found in endothelial cells. The p75NTR protein expression was found in situ in lesional and non-lesional mast cells. A significantly increased expression of p75NTR protein was found in atopic dermatitis lesional mast cells when compared with control mast cell expression (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The demonstration of an increased level of p75NTR gene transcription  in lesional mast cells points to an induction of low-affinity neurotrophin receptor sensitivity of mast cells under states of allergic inflammation. Topically administered neurotrophin receptor-modulating compounds may act as anti-inflammatory mediators in cutaneous allergic inflammation.  DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2222.2008.02994.x 	18477014

Author information:  (1)Genetic Skin Disease Group, St John's Institute of Dermatology, Division of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, The Guy's, King's College and St Thomas' School  of Medicine, London, UK. john.mcgrath@kcl.ac.uk  One of the principal functions of human skin is to form an effective mechanical barrier against the external environment. This involves the maturation and death  of epidermal keratinocytes as well as the assembly of a complex network of differentially and spatially expressed proteins, glycoproteins and lipids into the keratinocyte cell membrane and surrounding extracellular space. In 2006, the  key role of the granular cell layer protein filaggrin (filament-aggregating protein) in maintaining the skin barrier was determined with the identification of loss-of-function mutations in the profilaggrin gene (FLG). These mutations have been shown to be the cause of ichthyosis vulgaris and a major risk factor for the development of atopic dermatitis, asthma associated with atopic dermatitis as well as systemic allergies. Mutations in the FLG gene are extremely common, occurring in approximately 9% of individuals from European populations. The remarkable discovery of these widespread mutations is expected to have a major impact on the classification and management of many patients with ichthyosis and atopic disease. It is also hoped that the genetic discovery of FLG mutations will lead to the future development of more specific, non-immunosuppressive treatments capable of restoring effective skin barrier function and alleviating or preventing disease in susceptible individuals.

K6PC-5, a direct activator of sphingosine kinase 1, promotes epidermal differentiation through intracellular Ca2+ signaling.  Hong JH(1), Youm JK, Kwon MJ, Park BD, Lee YM, Lee SI, Shin DM, Lee SH.  Author information:  (1)Department of Oral Biology, Brain Korea 21 Project, Oral Science Research Center, Center for Natural Defense System, Yonsei University College of Dentistry, Seoul, Korea.  Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive sphingolipid metabolite, regulates multiple cellular responses such as Ca(2+) signaling, growth, survival, and differentiation. Because sphingosine kinase (SphK) is the enzyme directly responsible for production of S1P, many factors have been identified that regulate its activity and subsequent S1P levels. Here we synthesized a previously unidentified SphK activator, K6PC-5, and have studied its effects on intracellular Ca(2+) signaling in HaCaT cells and epidermal differentiation in murine skin. K6PC-5, a hydrophobic compound chemically named N-(1,3-dihydroxyisopropyl)-2-hexyl-3-oxo-decanamide, activated SphK (obtained from C57BL/6 murine blood and F9-12 cell lysates) in a dose-dependent manner. K6PC-5 induced both intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) oscillations in HaCaT cells and Ca(2+) mobilization in hairless mouse epidermis. Both dimethylsphingosine (DMS) and dihydroxysphingosine (DHS), SphK inhibitors, and transfection of SphK1-siRNA blocked K6PC-5-induced increases in [Ca(2+)](i). The  K6PC-5-induced [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations were dependent on thapsigargin-sensitive  Ca(2+) stores and Ca(2+) entry, but independent of the classical phospholipase C-mediated pathway. In addition, K6PC-5 enhanced the expression of involucrin and filaggrin, specific differentiation-associated marker proteins in HaCaT cells, whereas transfection of SphK1-siRNA blocked the increase of involucrin. Topical K6PC-5 also enhanced the expression of involucrin, loricrin, filaggrin, and keratin 5 in intact murine epidermis. Finally, topical K6PC-5 inhibited epidermal hyperplasia by exerting antiproliferative effects on keratinocytes in murine epidermis. These results suggest that K6PC-5 acts to regulate both differentiation and proliferation of keratinocytes via [Ca(2+)](i) responses through S1P production. Thus, regulation of S1P levels may represent a novel approach for treatment of skin disorders characterized by abnormal differentiation and proliferation, such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.

Howell MD(1), Fairchild HR, Kim BE, Bin L, Boguniewicz M, Redzic JS, Hansen KC, Leung DY.  Author information:  (1)Department of Pediatrics, National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver, Colorado 80206, USA.  Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory skin disease associated with frequent skin infection and impaired skin barrier function. Recent studies indicate that increased Th2 cytokine expression contributes to reduction in antimicrobial peptides and reduced filaggrin (FLG) expression, however, the mechanisms leading  to this effect is unknown. Using proteomics, we found the S100 calcium-binding protein A11 (S100/A11) to be significantly downregulated in the presence of IL-4  and IL-13. Culturing keratinocytes with increased calcium concentrations significantly induced S100/A11 expression. This corresponded with an increase in  human beta-defensin (HBD)-3 and FLG expression. Interference of S100/A11 expression, by siRNA, inhibited induction of HBD-3 and FLG. Furthermore p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor downstream of S100/A11, was required for calcium-mediated induction of HBD-3 and FLG. Importantly, transduction of p21-recombinant protein into keratinocytes prevented IL-4/IL-13-mediated inhibition of FLG and HBD-3 expression. S100/A11 and p21 gene expression was also found to be significantly lower in acute and chronic AD skin. This study demonstrates an important role for S100/A11 and p21 in regulating skin barrier integrity and the innate immune response.  DOI: 10.1038/jid.2008.74 	18385759

Author information:  (1)Brain Korea 21 Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.  Comment in     J Invest Dermatol. 2008 Aug;128(8):1878-80.  Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) is known to be involved in epidermal permeability barrier function homeostasis. PAR-2 activation occurs after barrier  disruption and further activation of PAR-2 by activating peptide significantly delays barrier recovery rate. Cockroach and house dust mite allergens, both known to be associated with the development of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis, have protease activity, which can activate PAR-2. In this study, we investigated the effects of both allergens on the epidermal barrier function as well as on the epidermal calcium gradient. Both allergens, when topically applied on the barrier-disrupted site, increased protease activities in the epidermis and delayed barrier recovery and lamellar body secretion in murine skin. The topical  application of PAR-2-specific antagonist or protease inhibitors normalized the barrier recovery. Cockroach allergens induced intracellular calcium oscillations  in cultured human keratinocytes through PAR-2-involved pathway, which was confirmed by desensitization protocol. Abnormal calcium ion distribution after barrier disruption was also observed in allergens-applied skin. These results suggest that allergens with protease activity can influence the epidermal permeability barrier homeostasis through PAR-2 activation and consequent modulation of the calcium ions in skin.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. kagamis-tky@umin.ac.jp  CCL27 is one of the CC chemokines produced by epidermal keratinocytes and is suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases. To clarify the contribution of CCL27 in skin inflammation, we created transgenic C57BL/6 mice that constitutively produce CCL27 in epidermal keratinocytes. These  mice had high serum CCL27 levels and did not show any phenotypical change. Thus we stimulated these mice with various reagents by single and repeated application. Interestingly, only contact hypersensitivity to repeated application with fluorescein isothiocyanate was significantly enhanced in transgenic mice compared to non-transgenic mice. Under this condition, the numbers of inflammatory cells, CCR10-positive cells, CCR4-positive cells and cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen-positive cells were increased, and IL-4 mRNA expression was higher in the lesional skin of transgenic mice. Increased number of mast cells and higher serum IgE levels, which were similar to atopic dermatitis, were also observed. These results indicated that CCL27 modified inflammation by attracting CCR10-positive and CCR4-positive cells into the lesional skin, and may participate in the pathogenesis of Th2-shifted skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis.

Recent studies demonstrate that the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin LL-37 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atopic eczema,  rosacea and psoriasis. Whereas skin in atopic eczema shows decreased cathelicidin expression which leads to increased susceptibility to superinfection in those patients, overabundant expression of cathelicidin peptide fragments causes inflammation in rosacea. Finally, in psoriasis cathelicidin peptide binds to self DNA which triggers an autoimmune response. These studies demonstrate the role of  cathelicidin as a central factor in the pathogenesis of cutaneous inflammation. Therapies targeting cathelicidin expression and function could lead to new treatments for these diseases.  DOI: 10.1007/s00105-007-1457-z 	18209993

Author information:  (1)MRC Human Immunology Unit, University of Oxford, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Oxford, OX3 9DS, UK.  BACKGROUND: Blockade of lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) is proving successful in the management of psoriasis and other inflammatory skin conditions including atopic dermatitis (AD), but the dependence of allergen-specific CD4+ T-cell function on LFA-1 has not been studied extensively. OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate the potential ability of LFA-1 inhibition to influence keratinocyte presentation of allergen to specific T-helper (Th) 2 cell  clones. METHODS: Using human leucocyte antigen class II tetrameric complexes, we generated Der p 1-specific DRB1*1501-restricted CD4+ T-cell lines (n=5) and clones (n=4) from the peripheral blood of five adults with AD. RESULTS: Using doses of anti-LFA-1 present in vivo, we observed significant inhibition (P<0.05) of allergen-specific CD4+ T-cell production of interleukin-4  with such inhibition occurring during presentation of allergen by keratinocytes. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that at doses present in vivo, LFA-1 blockade inhibits keratinocyte presentation to allergen-specific Th2 cells, suggesting one mechanism through which anti-LFA-1 may be beneficial therapeutically.

Kim BE(1), Leung DY, Boguniewicz M, Howell MD.  Author information:  (1)Department of Pediatrics, National Jewish Medical and Research Center, 1400 Jackson Street, Denver, CO 80206, USA.  Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by a defective skin barrier which allows  increased allergen and pathogen penetration. Loricrin (LOR) and involucrin (IVL)  are proteins important for skin barrier formation and integrity. In this study, we demonstrate that the gene and protein expression of LOR and IVL is significantly decreased in involved (LOR: p<0.001; IVL: p<0.001) and uninvolved (LOR: p<0.001; IVL: p<0.001) skin of AD subjects, as compared to skin from healthy subjects. Using primary keratinocytes, we further demonstrate the down-regulatory effect of IL-4 and IL-13--which are over-expressed in the skin of AD patients--on LOR and IVL expression in keratinocytes. Additionally, skin biopsies from signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-6 transgenic mice were deficient in the expression and production of LOR and IVL. This study suggests that Th2 cytokines inhibit expression of LOR and IVL through  a STAT-6 dependent mechanism.  DOI: 10.1016/j.clim.2007.11.006  PMCID: PMC2275206	18166499

TLRs are expressed on many different cell types in the skin, including keratinocytes and Langerhans cells in the epidermis. Each TLR can recognize a different microbial component and there are differences among the TLR signaling pathways, which lead to distinct immune responses against a given pathogen. Certain TLRs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and acne vulgaris. In addition, TLRs have been shown to be important in cutaneous host defense mechanisms against common bacterial, fungal,  and viral pathogens in the skin, such as S aureus, C albicans, and HSV. Since the discovery that topical TLR agonists promote antiviral and antitumor immune responses, there has been considerable interest in the development of TLR-based therapies for skin diseases, skin cancer, and infections. Future research involving TLRs in skin will hopefully provide new insights into host defense against skin pathogens and novel therapeutic targets aimed at treating skin disease and skin cancer.

Author information:  (1)Klinik und Poliklinik für Dermatologie und Allergologie, Ludwig-Maximilian-University, Munich, Germany. Thomas.Herzinger@lrz.uni-muenchen.de  Erratum in     Am J Clin Dermatol.2008;9(4):277.  Sphingolipids have long been viewed as rather passive structural components of cellular membranes. More recently, it has become evident that metabolism of sphingomyelin yields several lipid mediators that evoke diverse and specific responses in different cell types. One sphingomyelin derivate, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), has attracted particular attention for its effect  on epidermal cells, which differs from those on most other cell types. S1P inhibits keratinocyte proliferation and induces keratinocyte differentiation and  migration, suggesting a role for S1P in the re-epithelialization of wounds. The migratory response involves the phosphorylation and activation of Smad3. In epithelial tumors, S1P signaling has been linked with potential oncogenic effects, but has also been found to inhibit metastasis in a mouse melanoma model. S1P promotes endothelial cell survival, acts as a chemoattractant for vascular cells, and exerts a protective effect on the endothelial barrier. Conversely, S1P receptor knockout leads to embryonic lethality mainly due to impaired vascular maturation. S1P presumably modulates peripheral T-lymphocyte levels by stimulating their egress from lymphoid organs rather than by promoting T-cell proliferation. The S1P analog FTY720 (fingolimod) acts as a functional antagonist by inhibiting lymphocyte egress, and thus holds great promise as an immunosuppressant drug for the prevention of allograft rejection and treatment of T-lymphocyte-driven inflammatory skin diseases, such as lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis. Topical use of S1P and other sphingosine compounds is also under investigation, particularly for the treatment of acne vulgaris.  	18039015

Chen L(1), Marble DJ, Agha R, Peterson JD, Becker RP, Jin T, Li J, Chan LS.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60612, USA.  The role angiogenesis plays in atopic dermatitis is not well understood. The authors previously demonstrated ultrastructurally dermal microvascular angiogenesis in the IL-4-transgenic mouse model of atopic dermatitis. Here, they  determine the angiogenic factors involved in dermal microvascular angiogenesis, regulatory function of inflammatory cytokines on the VEGF-A production, and microvascular permeability in this model. Computer-assisted photometric analyses  for immunofluorescence-labeled CD31 demonstrated a progressive increase in blood  vessel number, diameter, and percent dermal areas occupied by CD31(+) vessels as  the disease evolves in transgenic mice from before disease onset through early and late skin lesions. Similar findings were documented for VEGR2(+) vessels. Quantification of skin angiogenic factor mRNAs showed progressive increase of transcripts of VEGF-A, but not VEGF-B, VEGF-C, or VEGF-D. ELISA showed a similar  increase of VEGF-A in the serum and skin of transgenic mice. IL-6 and IFN-gamma stimulated VEGF-A mRNA production in the skin and in primary keratinocytes of transgenic mice. Other skin angiogenic factors that increased included Ang-1, Ang-2, GBP-1, and VE-cadherin. Microvascular leakage began in the transgenic mouse skin before disease onset and peaked in the late stage. In conclusion, IL-6 and IFN-gamma may play important roles in upregulation of VEGF-A, along with other pro-angiogenic factors, to induce dermal microvascular angiogenesis.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of California, Davis, School of Medicine, Dermatology Research, TB 192, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616, USA.  Beta2 adrenergic receptors were identified in keratinocytes more than 30 years ago, but their function in the epidermis continues to be elucidated. Abnormalities in their expression, signaling pathway, or in the generation of endogenous catecholamine agonists by keratinocytes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cutaneous diseases such as atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, and psoriasis. New studies also indicate that the beta2AR also modulates keratinocyte migration, and thus can function to regulate wound reepithelialization. This review focuses on the function of these receptors in keratinocytes and their contribution to cutaneous physiology and disease.  DOI: 10.1016/j.det.2007.06.012  PMCID: PMC2169297	17903623

Schallreuter KU(1), Wei Y, Pittelkow MR, Swanson NN, Gibbons NC, Wood JM.  Author information:  (1)Clinical and Experimental Dermatology, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Bradford, Bradford, UK. k.schallreuter@bradford.ac.uk  The density of beta2-adrenoceptors is significantly decreased in both keratinocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with atopic eczema.  Furthermore both cell types showed a sixfold increase in the K(D) for the specific binding of the non-specific antagonists (-)-[(3)H]CGP 12177 and [(125) I]CYP to keratinocytes and lymphocytes respectively compared with healthy controls. Based on these results polymorphism in the beta2-adrenoceptor gene was  suspected. Consequently the entire intronless beta2-adrenoceptor gene was isolated from whole blood and by RT-PCR from keratinocyte extracts of nine patients with atopic eczema and four healthy controls. DNA sequence analysis of nine atopic eczema patients confirmed a substitution in codon (1618) GCC (Ala(119)) to GAC (Asp(119)). This point mutation is expressed on the third transmembrane helix only 13A away from the established agonist/antagonist binding site at Asp(113). Computer modelling of this third transmembrane helix revealed substantial structural changes in the mutant compared with the wild type. Epidermal keratinocytes were established from one patient with atopic eczema (homozygote), the mother (heterozygote) and one age-matched healthy control. Cells were grown in media containing different concentrations of l-phenylalanine  and receptor densities were determined. The results showed that cells with atopic eczema showed an increased sensitivity to l-phenylalanine concentrations with a narrow homeostasis compared with healthy controls. The heterozygous mother was only 50% as sensitive as the child. In summary, the results indicate that atopic  eczema is associated with a single point mutation in the beta2-adrenoceptor gene  leading to an impaired adrenergic response in the epidermis of these patients.

Author information:  (1)Department of Immunology and Center for Cancer Immunology Research, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, TX 77030-1903, USA. yjliu@mdanderson.org  It was demonstrated 5 years ago that thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a IL-7-like cytokine produced by epithelial cells, could strongly activate human myeloid dendritic cells to induce an inflammatory T(H)2 response characterized by high TNF-alpha and little IL-10 production, distinct from the regulatory T(H)2 responses characterized by low TNF-alpha and high IL-10 production. TSLP was found highly expressed by keratinocytes of skin lesions of atopic dermatitis and  associated with dendritic cell activation in situ. This suggests for the first time that TSLP represents a master switch of allergic inflammation at the epithelial cell and dendritic cell interface. During the last several years, the  evidence for the association of TSLP with human asthma was revealed. The direct link between TSLP expression with the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis and asthma in vivo was demonstrated. In addition, OX40 ligand was found to be the TSLP-induced molecule on dendritic cells that triggers inflammatory T(H)2 differentiation in the absence of IL-12. TSLP was also demonstrated to direct the innate phase of allergic immune responses through activating mast cells. Therefore, TSLP and OX40 ligand may represent important targets for intervention  of the initiation of allergic inflammatory responses.  DOI: 10.1016/j.jaci.2007.06.004 	17666213
213. J Invest Dermatol. 2007 Sep;127(9):2228-35. Epub 2007 Jul 5.	 Possible roles of epidermal opioid systems in pruritus of atopic dermatitis.  Tominaga M(1), Ogawa H, Takamori K.  Author information:  (1)Institute for Environmental and Gender Specific Medicine, Juntendo University  Graduate School of Medicine, Urayasu, Chiba, Japan.  The micro-opioid (beta-endorphin/micro-opioid receptor) and kappa-opioid (dynorphin A (DynA)/kappa-opioid receptor) systems play pivotal roles in the modulation of pruritus in the central nervous system. The micro-opioid system has also been identified in human epidermis, raising the possibility that the system  controls the peripheral itch. However, the precise distribution of the kappa-opioid system has not yet been clarified in human epidermis. To address this issue, reverse transcription-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on cultured keratinocytes and normal skins from humans. The analyses revealed that epidermal keratinocytes express kappa-opioid receptor and its ligands, DynA (1-17) and DynA (1-8). Moreover, expression for micro- and kappa-opioid systems was examined immunohistochemically in skin biopsies from healthy volunteers and patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) before and after psoralen-ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy. Our expression analyses showed that only the kappa-opioid system, not the micro-opioid system, was downregulated in the epidermis of AD patients. The downregulation of the micro-opioid system and the restoration of the kappa-opioid system by PUVA therapy were observed in the AD patients, concomitant with a decrease of VAS (visual analogue scale) scores. These results suggest epidermal opioid systems are associated with the modulation of pruritus in AD. This new finding may help us to understand the control mechanism of peripheral itch.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, Teikyo University, Tokyo, Japan. nmk@med.teikyo-u.ac.jp  BACKGROUND: A chemokine CCL27 recruits skin-homing T cells. CCL27 production by epidermal keratinocytes is dependent on nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity and is enhanced in lesions with atopic dermatitis or allergic contact dermatitis. A lipid mediator leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) may be involved in the development of these allergic dermatoses. LTB(4) acts on cell surface G-protein-coupled receptors, BLT1 and BLT2. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro effects of LTB(4) on CCL27 production in human keratinocytes. METHODS: Keratinocytes were incubated with TNF-alpha and LTB(4). CCL27 secretion  and mRNA levels were analysed by ELISA and RT-PCR, respectively. NF-kappaB activities were analysed by luciferase assays. Protein levels or phosphorylation  status were analysed by cell-based ELISA. RESULTS: LTB(4) alone did not enhance CCL27 production and modestly enhanced NF-kappaB activity in human keratinocytes. However, LTB(4) potently enhanced TNF-alpha-induced CCL27 secretion and mRNA expression and NF-kappaB activity. LTB(4) alone or together with TNF-alpha, induced phosphorylation and degradation  of inhibitory NF-kappaB alpha (IkappaBalpha) and phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65. These effects of LTB(4) were suppressed by BLT1 antagonist U75302, pertussis toxin, phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase inhibitor U0126, but not by BLT2 antagonist  LY255283. LTB(4) induced phosphorylation of ERK and Akt, downstream kinase of PI3K; LY294002 suppressed phosphorylation of both kinases while U0126 suppressed  only the former. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that LTB(4) may enhance TNF-alpha-induced CCL27 production by activating NF-kappaB via the BLT1/G(i/o)/PI3K/ERK pathway in human  keratinocytes. LTB(4) may contribute to the enhanced CCL27 production of keratinocytes in lesions with atopic dermatitis or allergic contact dermatitis.  DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2222.2007.02743.x 	17581202

Effect of matrine on the expression of substance P receptor and inflammatory cytokines production in human skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts.  Liu JY(1), Hu JH, Zhu QG, Li FQ, Wang J, Sun HJ.  Author information:  (1)Department of Pharmacy, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China. liujiyong999@yahoo.com.cn  Matrine is a kind of alkaloid found in certain Sophora plants, which has been extensively used in China for the treatment of viral hepatitis, cancer, cardiac diseases and skin diseases (such as atopic dermatitis and eczema). It also has been confirmed that substance P (SP) and its receptor (neurokinin-1 receptor, NK-1R) are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin disorders. So the present study was designed to investigate the effect of matrine on the expression of NK-1R and cytokines production induced by SP in HaCaT cells (a human epidermal keratinocyte cell line) and dermal fibroblasts. In addition, cell viability was also evaluated. The results showed that matrine inhibited the expression of NK-1R in HaCaT cells and fibroblasts. SP induced the production of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-8, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 in both cell types. Matrine 5-100 microg/mL had little effect on cell viability. It inhibited SP-induced IL-1beta, IL-8 and MCP-1 production in HaCaT cells and fibroblasts, while it increased the production of IFN-gamma in HaCaT cells. Both SP and matrine had no effect on the secretion of IL-6. These findings suggest that matrine may have potential treatment function on SP related cutaneous inflammation by inhibition of the expression of substance P receptor and regulation of the production of inflammatory cytokines.

Boniface K(1), Diveu C, Morel F, Pedretti N, Froger J, Ravon E, Garcia M, Venereau E, Preisser L, Guignouard E, Guillet G, Dagregorio G, Pène J, Moles JP,  Yssel H, Chevalier S, Bernard FX, Gascan H, Lecron JC.  Author information:  (1)UPRES-EA 3806, Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.  Cutaneous inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis vulgaris and atopic dermatitis  are associated with altered keratinocyte function, as well as with a particular cytokine production profile of skin-infiltrating T lymphocytes. In this study we  show that normal human epidermal keratinocytes express a functional type II oncostatin-M (OSM) receptor (OSMR) consisting of the gp130 and OSMRbeta components, but not the type I OSMR. The type II OSMR is expressed in skin lesions from both psoriatic patients and those with atopic dermatitis. Its ligand, OSM, induces via the recruitment of the STAT3 and MAP kinase pathways a gene expression profile in primary keratinocytes and in a reconstituted epidermis that is characteristic of proinflammatory and innate immune responses. Moreover,  OSM is a potent stimulator of keratinocyte migration in vitro and increases the thickness of a reconstituted epidermis. OSM transcripts are enhanced in both psoriatic and atopic dermatitic skin as compared with healthy skin and mirror the enhanced production of OSM by T cells isolated from diseased lesions. Results from a microarray analysis comparing the gene-modulating effects of OSM with those of 33 different cytokines indicate that OSM is a potent keratinocyte activator similar to TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-17, and IL-22 and that it acts in synergy with the latter cytokines in the induction of S100A7 and beta-defensin 2  expression, characteristic of psoriatic skin. Taken together, these results demonstrate that OSM and its receptor play an important role in cutaneous inflammatory responses in general and that the specific effects of OSM are associated with distinct inflammatory diseases depending on the cytokine environment.  	17372020

Two-dimensional electrophoresis analyses of atopic dermatitis and the chances to  detect new candidate proteins by the variations in immobilized pH gradient strips.  Park YD(1), Lyou YJ, Yang JM.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul 135-710, Republic of Korea.  BACKGROUND: Proteomic approaches, one of the high-throughput technologies, have been used to search for the proteins that are abnormally expressed in human diseases. The atopic dermatitis (AD)-associated genes or proteins are gradually being reported. OBJECTIVE: In accordance with recent reports, we conducted the serial proteomic studies to compare with the protein expression level and to find a critical protein associated with AD. METHODS: We applied two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with MADI-TOF  as well as LC-MS/MS to detect dysregulated protein in the AD proteome obtained from the patient-derived primary cells. Real-time PCR was also conducted to compare with the proteomic results in the transcriptional level. RESULTS: We successfully detected new AD-associated proteins in the AD-derived fibroblasts 2D-PAGE studies due to the IPG strip variations after conducting MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and identification of the proteins. From the real-time PCR quantifications, we found that the altered expression of caldesmon  1 isoform 5, nucleophosmin 1, esterase D and chloride intracellular channel 4 were well matched both at the transcriptional and translational levels, and this  suggested that these proteins may have important involvement with the pathogenesis of AD. CONCLUSION: By simply repeating the trials with changing the commercial strips with different lot numbers in the 2D-PAGE analysis, this provided us with new finding in the AD-derived samples. This approach we used may increase the chances of finding new candidate proteins in the clinical samples and it may also be applicable for proteomic studies of other diseases.

Author information:  (1)Cutaneous Psychoneuroimmunology, Internal Medicine - Psychosomatics, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany. frl_peters@yahoo.com  Neurotrophins regulate cutaneous innervation, act as growth and motility factors  on structural skin cells such as keratinocytes and fibroblasts, modulate cutaneous immune function and even serve as stress mediators in skin biology. The multilayered neurotrophin interaction with skin biology through high affinity specific tyrosinekinase receptors and the Janus-faced p75 receptor, which depending on ligand and co-receptor expression can serve as a low-affinity pan-neurotrophin receptor or a high affinity proneurotrophin receptor, guaranties this neuroendocrine peptide family a central position in the control of skin homeostasis in health and disease. It is a challenging task for future research efforts to integrate our knowledge on differential neurotrophin expression patterns and signaling pathways into complex concepts of neuroendocrine tissue remodeling and pathogenetic processes. In addition, we need to improve our understanding of the role of neurotrophin processing enzymes, associated co-receptors and intracellular adaptor molecules in specific cutaneous cell populations to design precise interaction tools for research and treatment. Such  tools will allow us to utilize this ancient growth factor family in the management of neurotrophin responsive pathogenetic pathways and cutaneous diseases such as neurogenic inflammation, peripheral nerve degeneration, wound healing, atopic dermatitis or psoriasis.

The aim of this work was to study Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2, 4 and 9 expression patterns in parapsoriasis and in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL): Mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS) at different stages of the illness. The expression of TLRs was examined by immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded biopsies. Normal skin, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, were used as controls. In cutaneous lesions of inflammatory diseases (atopic dermatitis, psoriasis) the expression of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 was low compared to  normal skin. In parapsoriasis the expression of the three TLRs was similar to control. By contrast, in MF skin we observed a strong intensity of labelling with the three TLRs in the epidermis. Concerning SS, the expression of TLR2, TLR4 and  TLR9 was intermediate between inflammatory lesions and MF. Thus, the development  of skin lesions in MF appears associated with an increase of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9  expression by keratinocytes in cutaneous lesions, which could play a role in the  chronic activation of T lymphocytes in the skin.  	17229603

Takano N(1), Sakurai T, Ohashi Y, Kurachi M.  Author information:  (1)Pharmacological Evaluation Laboratory, Self Medication Laboratories, Medicinal Development Research Laboratories, Taisho Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, Saitama City, Saitama, Japan. n.takano@po.rd.taisho.co.jp  BACKGROUND: Nerve growth factor (NGF) is an important substance in the skin, where it modulates nerve maintenance and repair. However, the direct link between NGF and pruritic diseases such as atopic dermatitis is not yet fully understood.  Our previous study showed that NGF plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice. NGF mediates its effects by binding to two classes of transmembrane receptors, a high-affinity receptor (tropomyosin-related kinase A, TrkA) and a low-affinity receptor (p75). OBJECTIVES: To determine the significance of NGF receptors in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, the effects of TrkA inhibitors AG879 and K252a on the symptoms of NC/Nga mice were evaluated. METHODS: Male NC/Nga mice with severe skin lesions were used. AG879 or K252a was  applied to the rostral part of the back of mice five times a week. The dermatitis score for the rostral back was assessed once a week. The scratching behaviour was measured using an apparatus, MicroAct (Neuroscience, Tokyo, Japan). Immunofluorescence examinations were made in the rostral back skin for nerve fibres, NGF and TrkA receptor. RESULTS: Repeated applications of AG879 or K252a significantly improved the established dermatitis and scratching behaviour, and decreased nerve fibres in the epidermis. NGF was observed more weakly in keratinocytes, and a lower expression of TrkA was observed in stratum germinativum of the epidermis of mice  treated with AG879 or K252a compared with those treated with vehicle. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that NGF plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions via the high-affinity NGF receptor. These findings provide a new potential therapeutic approach for the amelioration of symptoms of atopic dermatitis.  DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2006.07636.x 	17223862

Ashenagar MS(1), Sugihara K, Maeda A, Isogai R, Takahashi M, Aisu K, Horiuchi A,  Aragane Y, Kawada A, Tezuka T.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Kinki University School of Medicine, Osakasayama, Japan.  Human mast cells are well known to produce a serine protease, tryptase, which appears to play a pathogenic role in various skin inflammations. It was previously reported that a rat homologue of bikunin may inhibit tryptase activity. Various type of cells (i.e. keratinocytes) are able to produce this protein inhibitor, it still remains unclear if bikunin is present in dermal inflammatory milieu, in which mast cells, through secretion of tryptase, play an  inflammatory role. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to exploit expression and production of bikunin in dermis and dermal constituents. We first  compared the dermal mast cells in psoriatic lesions with those in lesional skin of atopic dermatitis or of chronic eczema by use of immunoelectron microscopy and immunohistochemical analyses using antibodies to bikunin and tryptase. Then, we tested what kinds of cytokines may regulate the de novo synthesis of bikunin. To  do so, RNA was extracted from a human mastocytic cell line, HMC-1, reverse-transcribed, and semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed using primers specific for bikunin. With immunoelectron microscopy, bikunin was found to localize on the cell membrane, while tryptase was in the secretary granules of the mast cells. In psoriatic lesions, around 70% of dermal mast cells were positive for both tryptase and bikunin, and the remaining was mostly positive for tryptase, but the expression of bikunin was under the detection limit of the experimental setting. This observation was seen in only psoriatic lesions, even in almost cured lesions, while in atopic dermatitis or chronic eczema only mast cells doubly positive for bikunin and tryptase were seen. In HMC-1, bikunin was constitutively expressed at an mRNA level, which was upregulated by stimulation with interleukine-4, but was suppressed by interferon-gamma. Bearing in mind the  concept that in psoriasis local cytokine milieu is shifted toward a Th1 pattern (predominant secretion of interferon-gamma), tryptase-positive, bikunin-negative  mast cells may be induced.

Author information:  (1)Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Cutaneous Physiopathology, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IRCCS, Roma, Italy.  ATP is abundantly released from stressed or damaged cells in response to mechanical stimulation, bacteria, or noxious agents. In this study, we have investigated the possible involvement of P2 receptors (receptor for extracellular nucleotides) in the expression and release of inflammatory mediators by human keratinocytes. Notably, extracellular ATP displayed a complex regulation of IFN-gamma-stimulated chemokine expression, with upregulation of CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL5 and CXC chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8), and suppression of the  receptor CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3), CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. The effect  of ATP was mimicked by ADP and adenosine-5'-O-3-thiotriphosphate, whereas 2',3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl) ATP (BzATP) downmodulated all chemokines investigated. UTP had no effect on IFN-gamma-stimulated chemokine secretion. The broad-spectrum P2 receptor antagonist suramin and the selective P2Y1 inhibitor adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate counteracted the effect of ATP on secretion of all the chemokines examined, whereas pyridoxal phosphate 6-azophenyl 2',4'-disulfonic acid and KN62 (1-[N,O-bis(5-isoquinoline sulfonyl)-N-methyl-L-tyrosyl] 4 phenylpiperazine) partially prevented the inhibitory effect of ATP on CXCL10 secretion, but on the other hand potentiated the ATP-stimulatory effect on CCL5,  CCL2, and CXCL8 release. In lesional skin of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis patients, intense P2X7 reactivity was confined to the cell membrane of the basal  layer, whereas diffuse P2Y1 immunostaining was found throughout the epidermis. Collectively, our data suggest that the orchestrated activation of distinct P2Y and P2X receptors modulates skin inflammation.  DOI: 10.1038/sj.jid.5700591 	17039239

In this study, we demonstrate significantly decreased expression of human beta defensin (HBD)-3, a  potent antimicrobial peptide (AMP), in lesional skin of both IAD (p<0.01) and EAD patients (p<0.01), as compared to psoriasis patients. Using primary keratinocytes from EAD and IAD patients, we determined that the deficiency in HBD-3 expression  is an acquired rather than a constitutive defect. Furthermore, we demonstrate the down-regulatory effect of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 - which are over-expressed in the skin of AD patients - on HBD-3 expression in keratinocytes. Additionally, treatment of EAD skin explants with antibodies against IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 augmented the expression of HBD-3. These studies suggest that neutralizing the Th2 cytokine milieu in AD skin may augment the innate immune response against bacterial and viral pathogens.  DOI: 10.1016/j.clim.2006.08.008 	17015038

Grando SA(1), Pittelkow MR, Schallreuter KU.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of California, Davis, 95817, USA. sagrando@ucdavis.edu  The presence of an autocrine adrenergic and cholinergic intra/intercellular signal transduction network in the human epidermis contributes significantly to homeostatic and compensatory responses regulating vital functions in keratinocytes and melanocytes. The ligands produced control autocrine and paracrine loops to initiate responses through cognate receptors expressed within  the same or adjacent cells. The epidermal adrenergic signal controls calcium homeostasis, cell growth, differentiation, motility, and pigmentation via the beta2 and alpha1 adrenoceptors. The cholinergic system is highly complex comprising both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors with multiple subtypes and this system plays an important role in keratinocyte cell cycle progression, differentiation, directional migration, adhesion, and apoptotic secretion. Moreover, lymphocytes also express adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. Both types of signal transduction receptors are coupled to classical intracellular second messenger pathways, including cAMP-, cGMP-, and calcium-mediated downstream responses. To date, it has been recognized that several dermatoses such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, Mal de Meleda, vitiligo, palmoplantar pustulosis, and pemphigus may be mediated, in part, by the non-neuronal adrenergic/cholinergic systems. A detailed understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of the adrenergic/cholinergic network in the skin could offer the development of specific drugs for novel treatment modalities.

[Article in Chinese]  Xie ZQ(1), Liu LL, Yang GY, Zhu XJ.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of Toll-like receptor(TLR) 2 and TLR4 in pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis(AD) and the effect of topical tacrolimus ointment on expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in lesional AD skin. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was employed to study the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in normal skin and lesional AD skin before and after using topical tacrolimus ointment. RESULTS: The basal keratinocytes in normal skin constitutively expressed TLR2 and TLR4. In contrast, lesional epidermis from 9 patients with acute AD overexpressed TLR2 and TLR4 on the whole epidermis keratinocytes with membranous and cytoplasmic staining pattern. After using topical tacrolimus ointment for three weeks, TLR2 and TLR4 were expressed on basal and suprabasal keratinocytes with membranous and cytoplasmic staining pattern. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that TLR2 and TLR4 expressed by epidermal keratinocytes constitute part of the innate immune system of the skin, and increased TLR2 and TLR4 expression may be related to the skin innate immuno-inflammatory response in atopic dermatitis. Topical tacrolimus may directly or indirectly inhibit or down-regulate TLR2 and TLR4 expression in KC and inhibit skin innate immuno-inflammatory response related to TLR-NFkappaB signal transduction and regulation in atopic dermatitis.  	16892151

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. ytsun-tky@umin.ac.jp  CC chemokine ligand (CCL)17 is implicated in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD). To study the effect of CCL17 produced by keratinocytes (KC) during inflammation, we created transgenic (Tg) mice in which CCL17 is overexpressed in KC. Th2-type contact hypersensitivity (CHS) was enhanced and Th1-type CHS was suppressed in these mice. Increased numbers of CC chemokine receptor (CCR)4(+) cells and mast cells infiltrated in Tg mice. Levels of IL-4 mRNA were higher and those of IFN-gamma mRNA were lower in both acute and chronic CHS. Higher levels of serum IgE were observed after CHS. Numbers of CCR4(+) cells among PBMC were increased in Tg mice challenged acutely on the trunk. Chronic irritation with croton oil induced dermatitis and an elevation of serum IgE levels. Tg mice showed enhanced ear swelling after tape stripping. CCL17 was thought to modify the inflammation caused by sensitizing reagents as well as irritant reagents by attracting CCR4(+) cells into the lesional skin and creating a Th2-dominant condition. AD-like conditions such as increased number of mast cells and elevated levels of serum IgE were observed. Thus, CCL17 may participate in the pathogenesis of skin diseases such as AD by regulating both allergic and irritant inflammation.  DOI: 10.1002/eji.200535564 	16856206

Increased interleukin-1beta mRNA expression in skin biopsies of horses with Culicoides hypersensitivity following challenge with Culicoides nubeculosus extract.  Kolm G(1), Knapp E, Wagner R, Klein D.  Author information:  (1)Department for Animal Breeding and Reproduction, Veterinary University Vienna, Veterinaerplatz 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria. gabriela.kolm@vu-wien.ac.at  Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is a primary cytokine of the skin that has a pivotal role in keratinocyte differentiation, epidermal wound healing and host defense. Pathological increase of cutaneous IL-1beta is associated with edema formation, epidermal hyperproliferation and atopic dermatitis in humans. However, in horses  the role of cutaneous IL-1beta in edema formation and allergic skin disease has not been characterised so far. Particularly in Culicoides hypersensitivity (CHS), intradermal injection of Culicoides extract may be associated with enhanced transcription of local IL-1beta. To examine the mRNA expression of IL-1beta and its receptor antagonist IL-1RA in the skin of horses, biopsy specimens of horses  affected and non-affected by CHS prior and following intradermal challenge with a commercial C. nubeculosus extract were examined. Our hypothesis was that cutaneous IL-1beta mRNA was significantly upregulated in horses with CHS in response to Culicoides allergen. Biopsies were taken from sites prior to and 4 h  following intradermal challenge with C. nubeculosus extract. In order to obtain reliable data, real time PCR was performed and genes of interest were normalized  using three different housekeeping genes, beta-actin, GAPDH, beta-2-microglobulin. No significant difference was detected in non-challenged cutaneous IL-1beta mRNA and IL-1RA mRNA levels between CHS affected and non-affected horses. Intradermal injection of C. nubeculosus extract resulted in  local upregulation of IL-1beta mRNA both in horses with typical history, characteristic clinical signs for CHS and a positive intradermal skin test (IDT), and non-affected horses with a negative IDT. However, the difference in prior and post challenged site IL-1beta mRNA levels only reached statistical significance in the affected horses (p=0.01 versus 0.7). In contrast, IL-1RA mRNA levels did not demonstrate any modification following intradermal injection with C. nubeculosus in either group. In contrast to human atopic dermatitis, clinically normal skin of horses affected by CHS is not characterized by increased maintenance levels of IL-1beta mRNA. C. nubeculosus stimulates local IL-1beta transcription in all horses independent from disease, but the extent of upregulation from basal levels only reaches statistical significance in horses affected by CHS and active stage of disease.

Suppressive effects of antimycotics on tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced CCL27, CCL2, and CCL5 production in human keratinocytes.  Kanda N(1), Watanabe S.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Teikyo University School of Medicine, 11-1, Kaga-2, Itabashi-Ku, Tokyo 173-8605, Japan. nmk@med.teikyo-u.ac.jp  Antimycotic agents are reported to improve cutaneous symptoms of atopic dermatitis or psoriasis vulgaris. Keratinocytes in these lesions excessively produce chemokines, CCL27, CCL2, or CCL5 which trigger inflammatory infiltrates.  Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) induces production of these chemokines via activating nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). We examined in vitro effects of antimycotics on TNF-alpha-induced CCL27, CCL2, and CCL5 production in human keratinocytes. Antimycotics ketoconazole and terbinafine hydrochloride suppressed TNF-alpha-induced CCL27, CCL2, and CCL5 secretion and mRNA expression in keratinocytes in parallel to the inhibition of NF-kappaB activity while fluconazole was ineffective. Anti-prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) antiserum or antisense  oligonucleotides against PGE2 receptor EP2 or EP3 abrogated inhibitory effects of ketoconazole and terbinafine hydrochloride on TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activity and CCL27, CCL2, and CCL5 production, indicating the involvement of endogenous PGE2 in the inhibitory effects. Prostaglandin H2, a precursor of PGE2  can be converted to thromboxane A2. Ketoconazole, terbinafine hydrochloride and thromboxane A2 synthase (EC 5.3.99.5) inhibitor, carboxyheptyl imidazole increased PGE2 release from keratinocytes and reduced that of thromboxane B2, a stable metabolite of thromboxane A2. Carboxyheptyl imidazole also suppressed TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activity and CCL27, CCL2, and CCL5 production. These  results suggest that ketoconazole and terbinafine hydrochloride may suppress TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activity and CCL27, CCL2, and CCL5 production by increasing PGE2 release from keratinocytes. These antimycotics may suppress thromboxane A2 synthesis and redirect the conversion of PGH2 toward PGE2. These antimycotics may alleviate inflammatory infiltration in atopic dermatitis or psoriasis vulgaris by suppressing chemokine production.  DOI: 10.1016/j.bcp.2006.05.001 	16784723

Severe itch accompanying various skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis is an important issue related to the quality of life. Although histamine from mast cells has been thought to play an essential role in itch, many severe pruritic diseases respond poorly to the H(1) histamine receptor antagonists. Therefore the precise mechanisms and mediators of itch in most pruritic diseases are unclear. To investigate the detailed mechanisms of the induction of itch, we have developed a mouse model. Studies using this model have demonstrated that keratinocytes play an important role in the induction of itch. The identification of keratinocyte stimulus factors and of products in keratinocytes could lead to developing new antipruritic medicines.  	16755126

Chen L(1), Lin SX, Agha-Majzoub R, Overbergh L, Mathieu C, Chan LS.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Illinois at Chicago, College of Medicine, MC624, 808 South Wood Street, Room 376, 60612, USA.  The keratin-14 IL-4 transgenic (Tg) mouse model of atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by skin infiltration of T cells, early up-regulation of T(h)2 cytokines and late surge of T(h)1 cytokines. In the present study, we investigated the role of CCL27, a T cell skin-homing chemokine known to be elevated in sera of human AD patients, in disease development in our animal model of AD. The results showed that the mRNA and protein levels of CCL27 in the skin and serum were significantly increased in IL-4 Tg mice. The percentage of T cells expressing CCR10 in skin draining lymph nodes of IL-4 Tg mice was increased, consistent with the findings of >80% of skin-infiltrating T cells in Tg mice expressing CCR10. Chemotaxis transmigration assay demonstrated that CCL27 promotes a greater degree of migration of T cells in diseased Tg mice. Subcutaneous injection of neutralizing anti-CCL27 to IL-4 Tg mice with early skin lesions resulted in reduced clinical progression of inflammation, accompanied with decreased T cell and mast cell infiltration in the skin, and down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, CCL27 and CCR10 interaction is important for the development of skin inflammation in our AD model.  DOI: 10.1093/intimm/dxl054 	16735375

Simon D(1), Lindberg RL, Kozlowski E, Braathen LR, Simon HU.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland. dagmar.simon@insel.ch  Keratinocyte apoptosis mediated by Fas/Fas ligand molecular interactions and subsequent caspase activation is believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD), in particular for the formation of spongiosis. To estimate epidermal caspase activation in normal and AD skin under  in vivo conditions, we analysed caspase-3 cleavage by immunohistology. In normal  skin as well as non-lesional AD skin, we detected caspase-3 cleavage in single cells of the basal layer. In contrast, in acute lesional AD skin, we not only obtained evidence for increased expression of cleaved caspase-3 in keratinocytes  of the basal layer but also observed caspase-3 cleavage in one or more layers of  the spinous cell layer, in particular in spongiotic areas. Short-term topical treatment of the skin lesions with tacrolimus or pimecrolimus abolished the expression of cleaved caspase-3 in the spinous layer. Moreover, epidermal caspase-3 cleavage correlated with the numbers of dermal interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-expressing CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in skin lesions of AD patients,  supporting the view that IFN-gamma is important for the activation of proapoptotic pathways in keratinocytes. This is also confirmed by the observation of increased Fas expression on keratinocytes in acute AD lesions that was markedly reduced following topical calcineurin inhibitor treatment. These data suggest that caspase-3 cleavage in the spinous layer of the epidermis is a pathologic event contributing to spongiosis formation in AD, whereas cleavage of  caspase-3 in basal cells might represent a physiologic mechanism within the process of epidermal renewal.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan. yfujita@med.hokudai.ac.jp  PURPOSE: Mycosis fungoides (MF), a common type of cutaneous T cell lymphoma with  an indolent clinical course, has the characteristic that malignant T cell clones  are recruited into the skin from the early disease stages. The mechanisms of recruitment have been suggested from our knowledge of various chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions. Recently, CCR10 and CTACK/CCL27 were proposed to play a role in the recruitment of other types of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. We examined  the expression of CCR10 in peripheral blood and serum CTACK/CCL27 levels in patients with MF. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eighteen patients with MF, six patients with atopic dermatitis, and nine healthy volunteers were enrolled in our investigation. We investigated the differences in CCR10+ CD4+ expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by flow cytometry. Serum CTACK/CCL27 levels were determined using a CTACK/CCL27 ELISA assay kit. RESULTS: The number of circulating CCR10+ CD4+ cells was significantly higher in  MF peripheral blood than in controls, even during the early stages. In lesional MF skin, infiltrating tumor cells also showed extensive expression of CCR10. The  serum level of CTACK/CCL27 was higher in patients with MF than normal controls, but no statistical difference was found compared with atopic dermatitis patients. CONCLUSIONS: CCR10-CTACK/CCL27 interactions between circulating T cells and keratinocytes would seem to play an important role in the pathophysiology of MF from the early disease stages.

Howell MD(1), Wollenberg A, Gallo RL, Flaig M, Streib JE, Wong C, Pavicic T, Boguniewicz M, Leung DY.  Author information:  (1)Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, National Jewish  Medical and Research Center, Denver, Colorado 80206, USA.  BACKGROUND: The cathelicidin family of antimicrobial peptides is an integral component of the innate immune response that exhibits activity against bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens. Eczema herpeticum (ADEH) develops in a subset of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) because of disseminated infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV). OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the potential role of cathelicidins in host susceptibility to HSV infection. METHODS: Glycoprotein D was measured by means of real-time RT-PCR as a marker of  HSV replication in skin biopsy specimens and human keratinocyte cultures. Cathelicidin expression was evaluated in skin biopsy specimens from patients with AD (n = 10) without a history of HSV skin infection and from patients with ADEH (n = 10). RESULTS: The cathelicidin peptide LL-37 (human cathelicidin) exhibited activity against HSV in an antiviral assay, with significant killing (P < .001) within the physiologic range. The importance of cathelicidins in antiviral skin host defense was confirmed by the observation of higher levels of HSV-2 replication in cathelicidin-deficient (Cnlp-/-) mouse skin (2.6 +/- 0.5 pg HSV/pg GAPDH, P < .05) compared with that seen in skin from their wild-type counterparts (0.9 +/- 0.3). Skin from patients with ADEH exhibited significantly (P < .05) lower levels of cathelicidin protein expression than skin from patients with AD. We also found a significant inverse correlation between cathelicidin expression and serum IgE levels (r2 = 0.46, P < .05) in patients with AD and patients with ADEH. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the cathelicidin peptide LL-37 possesses antiviral activity against HSV and demonstrates the importance of variable skin expression of cathelicidins in controlling susceptibility to ADEH. Additionally,  serum IgE levels might be a surrogate marker for innate immune function and serve as a biomarker for which patients with AD are susceptible to ADEH. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: A deficiency of LL-37 might render patients with AD susceptible to ADEH. Therefore increasing production of skin LL-37 might prevent  herpes infection in patients with AD.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology and Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cell Biology and  Immunobiology of the Skin, University Hospital Münster, Münster, Germany. schillm@uni-muenster.de  The innate immune system governs the interconnecting pathways of microbial recognition, inflammation, microbial clearance, and cell death. A family of evolutionarily conserved receptors, known as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), is crucial in early host defense against invading pathogens. Upon TLR stimulation, nuclear factor-kappaB activation and the interferon (IFN)-regulatory factor 3 pathway initiate production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1  and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and production of type I IFNs (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta), respectively. The innate immunity thereby offers diverse targets for highly selective therapeutics, such as small molecular synthetic compounds that modify innate immune responses. The notion that activation of the innate immune system is a prerequisite for the induction of acquired immunity raised interest in these immune response modifiers as potential therapeutics for viral infections and various tumors. A scenario of dermal events following skin cancer treatment with imiquimod presumably comprises (i) an initial low amount of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by macrophages and dermal dendritic cells (DCs), thereby (ii)  attracting an increasing number type I IFN-producing plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) from the blood; (iii) Langerhans cells migrate into draining lymph nodes, leading to an increased presentation of tumor antigen in the draining lymph node, and (iv) consequently an increased generation of tumor-specific T cells and finally (v) an accumulation of tumoricidal effector cells in the treated skin area. The induction of predominately T helper (Th)1-type cytokine profiles by TLR agonists  such as imiquimod might have further benefits by shifting the dominant Th2-type response in atopic diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis to a more potent Th1 response.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Clinical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Chongno-gu, Seoul, Korea. kyuhkim@snu.ac.kr  Staphylococcus aureus may perform an crucial function in atopic dermatitis (AD),  via the secretion of superantigens, including staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) A  or B, and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1). Dysregulated cytokine production by keratinocytes (KCs) upon exposure to staphylococcal superantigens (SsAgs) may  be principally involved in the pathophysiology of AD. We hypothesized that lesional KCs from AD may react differently to SsAgs compared to nonlesional skin  or normal skin from nonatopics. We conducted a comparison of HLA-DR or CD1a expression in lesional skin as opposed to that in nonlesional or normal skin by immunohistochemistry (IHC). We also compared, using ELISA, the levels of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha secreted by cultured KCs from lesional, nonlesional, and normal skin, after the addition of SEA, SEB and TSST-1. IHC revealed that both HLA-DR and CD1a expression increased significantly in the epidermis of lesional skin versus nonlesional or normal skin in quite a similar manner. IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha secretion was also significantly elevated in the cultured KCs from lesional skin after the addition of SsAgs. Our  results indicated that KCs from lesional skin appear to react differently to SsAgs and increased proinflammatory cytokine production in response to SsAgs may  contribute to the pathogenesis of AD.

Comment in     Immunity. 2006 Mar;24(3):245-7.  Atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with eczema vaccinatum (EV), a disseminated  viral skin infection that follows inoculation with vaccinia virus (VV). This study examined whether AD skin can control VV replication, and the role of IL-4 and IL-13 in modulating the human cathelicidin LL-37, an antimicrobial peptide that kills VV. AD skin exhibited increased VV replication and decreased LL-37 expression compared to normal or psoriasis skin. IL-4/IL-13 enhanced VV replication while downregulating LL-37 in VV-stimulated keratinocytes. Neutralizing IL-4/IL-13 in AD skin augmented LL-37 and inhibited VV replication.  Cathelicidins were induced via toll-like receptor-3 and were inhibited by IL-4/IL-13 through STAT-6. Skin from cathelicidin-deficient mice exhibited reduced ability to control VV replication. Exogenous LL-37 controlled vaccinia viral replication in infected keratinocytes and AD skin explants. The current study demonstrates that Th2 cytokines enhance VV replication in AD skin by subverting the innate immune response against VV in a STAT-6-dependent manner.

Author information:  (1)drbsbaker@aol.com  Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, fluctuating skin disease that is often associated with atopic conditions such as asthma and IgE-mediated food allergy and whose skin lesions are characterized by a Th-2 cell-mediated response to environmental antigens. The increasing prevalence and severity of atopic diseases including AD over the last three decades has been attributed to decreased exposure to microorganisms during early life, which may result in an altered Th-1/Th-2-balance and/or reduced T cell regulation of the immune response. Patients with AD exhibit defects in innate and acquired immune responses resulting in a heightened susceptibility to bacterial, fungal and viral infections, most notably colonization by S. aureus. Toxins produced by S. aureus  exacerbate disease activity by both the induction of toxin-specific IgE and the activation of various cell types including Th-2 cells, eosinophils and keratinocytes. Allergens expressed by the yeast Malazessia furfur, a component of normal skin flora, have also been implicated in disease pathogenesis in a subset  of AD patients. Microorganisms play an influential role in AD pathogenesis, interacting with disease susceptibility genes to cause initiation and/or exacerbation of disease activity.

Purwar R(1), Werfel T, Wittmann M.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology and Allergology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover,  Germany. purwarrahul@yahoo.com  Skin inflammation in atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by the predominant infiltration of T-helper (Th)2-cells in lesional skin. However, the mechanism of  recruitment of these cells in lesional skin of AD is not yet fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of IL-13-stimulated human primary keratinocytes (HPKs) in the recruitment of lymphocytes and further delineated the mechanism of enrichment of these cells. In the migration assays, we observed preferential enrichment of CD4(+)CCR4(+) T cells towards IL-13-stimulated HPKs. Interestingly, CD4(+)CCR4(+) T cells from AD showed a higher chemotactic response than those from healthy individuals. We observed a significant increase in the expression of CCL22 in IL-13-stimulated HPKs as compared to unstimulated cells. Blocking of CCL22 in IL-13-stimulated HPKs by a neutralizing antibody resulted in 70-90% inhibition in migration of CD4(+)CCR4(+) T cells. Moreover, IL-13 upregulated IFN-gamma-induced chemokines, CCL2 and CCL5, in HPKs. Taken together, our data suggest that IL-13-stimulated HPKs participate in a positive feedback loop by preferentially enriching Th2-cells in lesional skin of acute AD patients. However, in chronic phase, IL-13 may act in synergy with IFN-gamma resulting in lymphocytes recruitment of a mixed phenotype at the site of inflammation, thus contributing to the chronification of eczema.

Beissert S(1), Cavazzana I, Mascia F, Meroni P, Pastore S, Tessari G, Girolomoni  G.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Münster, Münster, Germany.  The skin is a frequent site of pathological immune responses that can take place  in the dermal and/or the epidermal compartments.These immunopathological reactions often occur towards innocuous antigens and may be the result of T cell-dependent and/or autoantibody dependent mechanisms. Defective immune regulation is increasingly recognized as very relevant in many skin and systemic  immune-mediated disorders. In some instances (e.g., psoriasis and atopic dermatitis) genetic predisposition can affect also the capacity of keratinocytes  to initiate or perpetuate inflammatory responses. A more precise understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying each disorder may allow the identification of novel targets for more effective therapeutic strategies.  	16466619

Boguniewcz, Mark [corrected to Boguniewicz, Mark].  BACKGROUND: IL-31 is a newly discovered T-cell cytokine that, when overexpressed  in mice, results in pruritus and skin dermatitis resembling human atopic dermatitis (AD). OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the expression of IL-31 and IL-31 receptor A  (IL-31RA) in skin biopsy specimens and peripheral blood cells from patients with  AD and healthy individuals. METHODS: Expression of IL-31 and IL-31RA was evaluated in skin biopsy specimens from patients with AD and healthy individuals by means of immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. IL-31 protein production by skin-homing cutaneous lymphocyte antigen  (CLA)-positive T cells was also assessed. RESULTS: IL-31RA protein was expressed by keratinocytes and infiltrating macrophages in skin biopsy specimens from patients with AD. Comparisons between skin from patients with AD and healthy skin showed IL-31RA expression at higher levels on epidermal keratinocytes in AD samples. Infiltrating cells, more numerous in skin from patients with AD compared with that of healthy individuals, expressed IL31 mRNA. Histomorphometric analysis of these cells indicated they were of the lymphocytic lineage, with the majority of cells staining positive for CLA and CD3. IL31 mRNA and protein expression is largely restricted to CD45RO(+)  (memory) CLA(+) T cells in peripheral blood of patients with AD and healthy volunteers. Moreover, circulating CLA(+) T cells from patients with AD, but not from patients with psoriasis, are capable of producing higher levels of IL-31 compared with CLA(+) T cells from healthy individuals. However, the average levels of IL-31 were not significantly different between patients with AD and healthy individuals. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence that IL-31 expression is associated with CLA(+) T cells and might contribute to the development of AD-induced skin inflammation and pruritus.

Kagami S(1), Saeki H, Komine M, Kakinuma T, Nakamura K, Tsunemi Y, Sasaki K, Asahina A, Tamaki K.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan. kagamis-tky@umin.ac.jp  Both CCL27 and CCL28 are ligands for CCR10 and attract CCR10(+) lymphocytes. We previously demonstrated that CCL27 and CCL28 were strongly expressed in sera and  lesional keratinocytes of patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis vulgaris. However, the regulation of CCL27 and CCL28 production in keratinocytes has not been well documented. In this study, we showed that CCL27 and CCL28 expression and production by a human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT cells, were strongly induced by inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta. CCL27 production was downregulated by inhibitors of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB). By contrast, CCL28 production was downregulated by inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and NF-kappaB. Our study results suggest that CCL28 produced by keratinocytes is mediated by different signal pathways from CCL27 and that both CCL27 and CCL28 are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases.

Kis K(1), Bodai L, Polyanka H, Eder K, Pivarcsi A, Duda E, Soos G, Bata-Csorgo Z, Kemeny L.  Author information:  (1)Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary. kiskori@freemail.hu  Topical immunosuppressant therapy is widely used in the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Besides its beneficial therapeutic effects, application of topical anti-inflammatory drugs may render the epidermis more vulnerable to invading pathogens by suppressing innate immune  responses in keratinocytes, such as cytokine production and Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression. In order to evaluate and compare the immunosuppressive effects  of different immunosuppressant drugs on keratinocytes, we treated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated and -unstimulated normal human keratinocytes  with the synthetic corticosteroid budesonide and the macrolide tacrolimus. The expressions of the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) TLR2 and TLR4 were measured by quantitative RT-PCR, pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-8 and TNF-alpha were monitored by quantitative RT-PCR and by ELISA, and alterations in  TLR2 protein level were measured by flow cytometry. Budesonide had a suppressive  effect on both constitutive and LPS-induced IL-8 gene expression. The amount of TNF-alpha mRNA was diminished in unstimulated keratinocytes, while TLR2 mRNA expression was markedly enhanced both in unstimulated and LPS-treated cells after incubation with budesonide. This increase in TLR2 mRNA expression was also detectable at the protein level in LPS-stimulated cells. Tacrolimus had no effect on any of the examined genes. Budesonide, but not tacrolimus, significantly inhibited the NF-kappaB-dependent luciferase reporter activity in HaCaT cells after induction with LPS or TNF-alpha. Although tacrolimus and budesonide are both effective treatments in some inflammatory skin diseases, the data provided here imply differences in local therapeutic and adverse effects of these two topical immunosuppressants.

Morimoto K(1), Nabeshima Y, Mochizuki M, Oomizu S, Yamamoto S, Hide M.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Division of Molecular Medical Science, Programs for Biomedical Research, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3, Kasumi, 734-8551 Hiroshima, Japan.  The increase of serum IgE levels is closely associated with atopic dermatitis. We have previously revealed that cellular extract of PAM212 cells (PAM-extract), BALB/c mouse keratinocyte cell line, induced a remarkable increase of serum IgE levels, in vivo, when subcutaneously injected into BALB/c mice. However, precise  mechanism of IgE-increasing activity was unclear. To elucidate the mechanism of IgE-increase in sera of BALB/c mice induced by PAM-extract, we explored the direct influence of PAM-extract on immunoglobulin production and class-switching  in the culture of splenic lymphocytes and purified B-cells, in vitro. Splenic lymphocytes or purified B-cells obtained from BALB/c mice were cultured with various combinations of IL-4, anti-CD40 antibody, and PAM-extract for 7 days. IgE and IgG concentrations of culture supernatants were measured by ELISA. Epsilon germ-line transcriptions were assessed by RT-PCR from the cultured cells. IgE and IgG concentrations in culture supernatant of splenic lymphocytes were increased by an addition of PAM-extract in the presence of both IL-4 and anti-CD40 antibody. Epsilon germ-line transcript was also induced in parallel to the increase of IgE production. Similar results were obtained when purified B-cells were employed in stead of whole splenic lymphocytes. The enhancement of IgE production in vitro was also observed, when splenic lymphocytes of CBAj mouse were cultured with cellular extract of KCMH-1 cells, CBAj mouse keratinocyte cell line. The cellular extract of keratinocyte promotes immunoglobulin class-switching to IgE and IgE production from mouse splenic B-cells in an IL-4-  and CD40-stimuli-dependent manner. Such enhancement may account for the increase  of serum IgE in patients with dermatitis in association with a Th2 microenvironment.  DOI: 10.1007/s00403-005-0636-y 	16402182

Verhagen J(1), Akdis M, Traidl-Hoffmann C, Schmid-Grendelmeier P, Hijnen D, Knol  EF, Behrendt H, Blaser K, Akdis CA.  Author information:  (1)Swiss Institute of Allergy and Asthma Research, Davos Platz, Switzerland.  BACKGROUND: The role of regulatory T cells has been widely reported in the suppression of T-cell activation. A dysfunction in CD4(+)CD25(+) T-regulatory cell-specific transcription factor FoxP3 leads to immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy X-linked syndrome, often associated with atopic dermatitis. Increasing the number and activity of regulatory T cells in affected  organs has been suggested as a remedy in various inflammatory diseases, including allergy. OBJECTIVE: To determine the presence and function of regulatory T cells in atopic dermatitis. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry of lesional atopic dermatitis skin and control skin conditions was used to demonstrate regulatory cells and cytokines in situ. The role of effector and regulatory T cells as well as their specific cytokines in apoptosis in human keratinocyte cultures and artificial skin equivalents was investigated. RESULTS: Human T-regulatory type 1 cells, their suppressive cytokines, IL-10 and  TGF-beta, as well as receptors for these cytokines were significantly expressed,  whereas CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) T-regulatory cells were not found in lesional and atopy patch test atopic dermatitis or psoriasis skin. Both subsets of regulatory  T cells suppress the allergen-specific activation of T(H)1 and T(H)2 cells. In coculture and artificial skin equivalent experiments, subsets of T-regulatory cells neither induced keratinocyte death nor suppressed apoptosis induced by skin T cells, T(H)1 cells, IFN-gamma, or TNF-alpha. CONCLUSION: A dysregulation of disease-causing effector T cells is observed in atopic dermatitis lesions, in association with an impaired CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+)  T-cell infiltration, despite the expression of type 1 regulatory cells in the dermis.

Comment in     J Invest Dermatol. 2006 Feb;126(2):239-41.  During pregnancy, maternal cells may enter the fetal circulation and persist until adulthood. The fate of these cells remains unknown. As unexplained T-cell-mediated conditions such as pityriasis lichenoides (PL) may occur in children, we aimed at identifying maternal cells in lesional skin of PL and controls. Archived skin biopsy specimens from young males with PL, atopic dermatitis, or normal skin were scanned for the presence of female (presumably maternal) cells using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with X and Y chromosome-specific probes. Phenotyping of maternal cells relied on FISH combined with anti-CD45, anti-CD1a, or anti-cytokeratin labelling, identifying leukocytes, Langerhans cells, and keratinocytes, respectively. Maternal cells were found in PL (11/12) and controls (4/7), but their average frequency was higher in PL: 99 per million cells as compared to 5 per million cells in controls (P = 0.005). In  the epidermis, the maternal microchimeric cells were labelled by anti-cytokeratin in all cases. We identified maternally derived keratinocytes in the skin of male  children with inflammatory skin disorders. These cells may either help repair the damaged skin or home initially in the skin and trigger a host (child) versus graft (mother) disease.  DOI: 10.1038/sj.jid.5700060 	16374466

High expression levels of keratinocyte antimicrobial proteins in psoriasis compared with atopic dermatitis.  de Jongh GJ(1), Zeeuwen PL, Kucharekova M, Pfundt R, van der Valk PG, Blokx W, Dogan A, Hiemstra PS, van de Kerkhof PC, Schalkwijk J.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.  Recently, it was shown that lesional skin of atopic dermatitis patients expresses low levels of some antimicrobial peptides, compared with psoriasis patients. Here we performed microarray analysis on mRNA from purified lesional epidermal cells of patients with chronic plaque psoriasis and chronic atopic dermatitis, to investigate whether this is a general phenomenon for host defense proteins, and how specific it is for this class of molecules. Microarray data were confirmed on a selected set of genes by quantitative PCR and at the protein level by immunohistochemistry. We found overexpression of many antimicrobial proteins in keratinocytes from psoriatic skin compared with atopic dermatitis skin. Interestingly, we observed that markers of normal differentiation and the activated/hyperproliferative epidermal phenotype were expressed at equal levels.  Chronic lesions of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis patients are remarkably similar with respect to cellular proliferation. We conclude that psoriatic epidermis expresses high levels of host defense proteins compared with atopic dermatitis epidermis, and this phenomenon appears to be specific for these proteins. It remains to be investigated whether this is caused by genetic polymorphisms in pathways leading to an epidermal antimicrobial response, or by differences in the cellular infiltrate in psoriasis compared with atopic dermatitis.

Author information:  (1)Division of Clinical Immunology/Allergy, Department of Pediatrics, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles/Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California,  Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA. pyong@chla.usc.edu  It is known that Staphylococcus aureus induces the expression of human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2), a well-characterized antimicrobial peptide, in keratinocytes. However, in spite of heavy colonization of atopic dermatitis (AD)  skin lesions by S. aureus, these lesions have consistently been shown to contain  low expression of hBD-2. The current article discusses various possible mechanisms for the low expression of hBD-2 in AD and raises the question whether  the innate recognition of S. aureus by keratinocytes in AD is intact.

The defect of the perforin granule system in cytotoxic T lymphocytes of atopic patients--are perforin reduction and hyperreleasability of clinical relevance?  Ambach A(1), Bonnekoh B, Gollnick H.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Germany. Andreas.Ambach@Medizin.Uni-Magdeburg.de  Perforin-containing lytic granules are secretory lysosomes of cytotoxic lymphocytes. They act as a negative regulator of activated T cells, control immunoglobulin production, contribute to the regulation of the TH1/TH2 balance, and occupy a central role in anti-viral defense mechanisms. This review focuses on recent evidence for a fundamental defect in the lymphocytic perforin system of atopic patients, namely perforin reduction and the hyperreleasability of perforin granules. These findings are set in relation to the immune imbalance in atopy, which is characterized by a weakly restrained proliferation of allergen-specific  T and B cells, a predominance of Ttype-2 cytokines, and an increased susceptibility to cutaneous infections. In the context of the wellknown defect of secretory lysosomes in mast cells and keratinocytes of atopic patients, the possibility of a cell type-independent major pathological factor in atopy is discussed: pan-cellular reduction and hyperreleasability of secretory lysosomes.  	16285645

Vassina E(1), Leverkus M, Yousefi S, Braathen LR, Simon HU, Simon D.  Author information:  (1)Department of Pharmacology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.  The tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis of many transformed but also of non-transformed cells. In addition, TRAIL receptor activation has been reported to activate non-apoptotic signaling pathways. Here, we report an increased expression of TRAIL in peripheral blood T  cells and monocytes from patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) compared with control individuals. High TRAIL expression was also observed in skin-infiltrating T cells of AD patients. Topical tacrolimus treatment reduced the total number of  T cells in the skin, but the relative proportion of TRAIL-positive cells within both CD4+ and CD8+ cell populations did not change. TRAIL was demonstrated to induce the expression of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) in keratinocytes in a caspase-independent manner in vitro. Moreover, increased expression of IL-1Ra was observed in keratinocytes of AD lesional skin. These data suggest that TRAIL-expressing inflammatory skin cells may contribute to the  epidermal activation of the IL-1Ra gene in AD.  DOI: 10.1111/j.0022-202X.2005.23878.x 	16185275

Author information:  (1)Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, The National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver, Colorado 80206, USA.  Erratum in     J Invest Dermatol. 2005 Dec;125(6):1320.  Recurrent skin infections in extrinsic atopic dermatitis (EAD) may be because of  the suppression of anti-microbial peptide (AMP) expression by interleukin (IL)-4  and IL-13. Twenty to thirty percent of AD, however, are classified as intrinsic atopic dermatitis (IAD). They exhibit normal serum IgE levels, no allergen-specific sensitization, and lower levels of IL-4 and IL-13 than EAD. Both forms of AD have increased propensity to skin infection, suggesting a novel  mechanism for infection in IAD. In this study, we observed significantly decreased human beta-defensin (HBD)-2 gene expression in the skin of both IAD (p  = 0.010) and EAD (p = 0.004), as compared with psoriasis patients. Conversely, IAD (p = 0.019) and EAD (p = 0.002) skin lesions exhibited elevated IL-10 gene expression when compared with psoriasis. Using primary keratinocytes, we found that the deficiency in AMP expression is an acquired rather than a constitutive defect. Interestingly, neutralizing antibodies to IL-10 augmented the production  of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma by peripheral blood mononuclear cell from AD patients. Additionally, treatment of AD skin explants with anti-IL-10 augmented the expression of both HBD-2 and LL-37. Thus, increased levels of IL-10 may contribute to the AMP deficiency in both IAD and EAD by reducing cytokines that induce AMP.  DOI: 10.1111/j.0022-202X.2005.23776.x 	16185274

Shimizu M(1), Matsuda A, Yanagisawa K, Hirota T, Akahoshi M, Inomata N, Ebe K, Tanaka K, Sugiura H, Nakashima K, Tamari M, Takahashi N, Obara K, Enomoto T, Okayama Y, Gao PS, Huang SK, Tominaga S, Ikezawa Z, Shirakawa T.  Author information:  (1)Laboratory for Genetics of Allergic Diseases, SNP Research Center, RIKEN, Yokohama, Japan.  Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disease associated with the  local infiltration of T helper type 2 (Th2) cells. The ST2 gene encodes both membrane-bound ST2L and soluble ST2 (sST2) proteins by alternative splicing. The  orphan receptor ST2L is functionally indispensable for Th2 cells. We found a significant genetic association between AD and the -26999G/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (chi2-test, raw P-value=0.000007, odds ratio 1.86) in the distal promoter region of the ST2 gene (chromosome 2q12) in a study of 452 AD patients and 636 healthy controls. The -26999A allele common among AD patients positively regulates the transcriptional activity of the ST2 gene. In addition, having at least one -26999A allele correlated with high sST2 concentrations and high total IgE levels in the sera from AD patients. Thus, the -26999A allele is correlated with an increased risk for AD. We also found that the -26999G/A SNP predominantly affected the transcriptional activity of hematopoietic cells. Immunohistochemical staining of a skin biopsy specimen from an AD patient in the  acute stage showed ST2 staining in the keratinocytes as well as in the infiltrating cells in the dermal layer. Our data show that functional SNPs in the ST2 distal promoter region regulate ST2 expression which induces preferential activation of the Th2 response. Our findings will contribute to the evaluation of one of the genetic risk factors for AD.  DOI: 10.1093/hmg/ddi323 	16118232

Kim JE(1), Kim BJ, Jeong MS, Seo SJ, Kim MN, Hong CK, Ro BI.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, College of Medicine, Chung Ang University, Korea.  Defensins and cathelicidins (LL-37) are major antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) of the innate immune system of the human skin. In normal non-inflamed skin these peptides are negligible, but their expression can be markedly increased in inflammatory skin disease such as psoriasis. We designed this study to identify the expressions of LL-37 in normal human keratinocyte (NHK) and HaCaT cells after exposure to stimulants and to investigate difference of LL-37 expression accompanied with cell differentiation status, and come to understand difference of susceptibility to infection in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Expressions of LL-37 in NHKs and HaCaT cells were evaluated by using RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining at 6, 12, and 24 hr post stimulation after exposure to Ultraviolet B irradiation and lipopolysaccharide. And expression of LL-37 in skin biopsy specimens from patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis was determined by immunohistochemical analysis. In time-sequential analyses of LL-37 expression revealed that LL-37 was expressed in NHKs, but not in HaCaT cells. IHC analysis confirmed the presence of abundant LL-37 in the epidermis of  psoriasis. Therefore we deduced that expression of LL-37 is affected by UV irradiation, bacterial infection, and status of cell differentiation.  DOI: 10.3346/jkms.2005.20.4.649  PMCID: PMC2782163	16100459

Author information:  (1)Laboratory for Gene-Expression Analysis, Center for Information Biology, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Shizuoka, Japan. koitoh@genes.nig.ac.jp  To identify differentially expressed genes which play causal roles in pathogenesis and maintenance for psoriasis, we used BodyMapping and introduced amplified fragment length polymorphism approaches. From the BodyMap database, we  selected 2007 genes which specifically expressed in epithelial tissues. Among 2007 genes, we surveyed genes which differentially expressed in involved or uninvolved psoriatic lesional skin samples compared with atopic dermatitis, mycosis fungoides, and normal skin samples. As a result of surveying 2007 genes,  241 genes were differentially expressed only in involved psoriatic skin but not in the other samples. Hierarchical cluster analysis of gene expression profiles showed that 13 independent psoriatic-involved skin samples clustered tightly together, reflecting highly similar expression profiles. Using the same 2007 gene set, we examined gene expression levels in five serial lesions from distal uninvolved psoriatic skin to involved psoriatic plaque. We identified seven genes such as alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor, calnexin, claudin 1, leucine zipper down-regulated in cancer 1, tyrosinase-related protein 1, Yes-associated protein 1, and unc-13-like protein (Coleonyx elegans) which show high-expression  levels only in uninvolved psoriatic lesions. These seven genes, which were reported to be related to apoptosis or antiproliferation, might have causal roles in pathophysiology in psoriasis.  DOI: 10.1111/j.0906-6705.2005.00338.x 	16098126

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Teikyo University, School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. nmk@med.teikyo-u.ac.jp  Atopic dermatitis is characterized by increased skin innervation. The expression  of neurotrophin-4 is enhanced in the epidermal keratinocytes of lesions with atopic dermatitis and may be related to hyperinnervation in these lesions. Prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) levels are increased in lesions with atopic dermatitis; thus, PGE(2) may be involved in the development of this disease. We examined the in vitro effects of PGE(2) on neurotrophin-4 production in human keratinocytes. PGE(2) and EP1/EP3 agonist sulprostone increased neurotrophin-4 secretion and mRNA levels without altering its mRNA stability. Antisense Sp1 oligodeoxynucleotide and Sp1 inhibitor mithramycin A suppressed PGE(2) and sulprostone-induced neurotrophin-4 expression, indicating the requirement for Sp1 for expression. PGE(2) or sulprostone markedly enhanced the phosphorylation, DNA  binding, and transcriptional activity of Sp1 and modestly increased Sp1 mRNA and  protein levels. PGE(2) or sulprostone induced the membrane translocation of protein kinase Calpha and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). PGE(2)-induced increases in neurotrophin-4 expression, Sp1 transcriptional and DNA-binding activity, Sp1 mRNA and protein levels, and ERK phosphorylation were suppressed by antisense EP3 oligodeoxynucleotide, inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, conventional protein kinase C,  and mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1). These results suggest that PGE(2) enhances neurotrophin-4 production by activating Sp1 via the EP3/phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C/protein kinase Calpha/MEK1/ERK  pathway. PGE(2) may promote innervation in skin lesions with atopic dermatitis via the induction of neurotrophin-4.  DOI: 10.1124/jpet.105.091645 	16081678

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. kagamis-tky@umin.ac.jp  Eotaxin-2/CCL24 and eotaxin-3/CCL26 are CC chemokines and their receptor, CC chemokine receptor 3 is preferentially expressed on eosinophils. It was reported  that vascular endothelial cells and dermal fibroblasts produced CCL26. However, the regulation of CCL24 and CCL26 production in keratinocytes has not been well documented. We investigated the expression and production of CCL24 and CCL26 in the human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT cells. Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction was performed using these cells and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was carried out using supernatant of these cells. The production of CCL24 in HaCaT cells was slightly enhanced by IL-4 and that of CCL26 was strongly enhanced by IL-4 and IL-13. Furthermore, TNF-alpha generated a synergistic effect on IL-4 enhanced CCL26 production. Dexamethasone, IFN-gamma and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor SB202190 inhibited IL-4 enhanced CCL26 production. IL-4 enhanced production of CCL26 was inhibited by leflunomide and JAK inhibitor 1, but not by JAK3 inhibitor, which indicates that  it is mediated by JAK1-STAT6-dependent pathway. This result also strongly suggests the involvement of the type 2 IL-4 receptor in IL-4 enhanced production  of CCL26. These results suggest that keratinocytes are involved in the migration  of CC chemokine receptor 3 positive cells such as eosinophils in a Th2-dominant situation like atopic dermatitis.

Therefore, Hom s 4 and homologous proteins found by sequence comparison in mice, fruit flies, and nematodes constitute a novel subfamily of calcium-binding proteins. Using Hom s 4-specific Abs, it is demonstrated that the protein is strongly expressed within epidermal keratinocytes and dermal endothelial cells. Purified Hom s 4 showed IgE cross-reactivity with exogenous calcium-binding allergens from plants and fish but, in contrast to the exogenous  allergens, induced only weak histamine release from patient basophils. However, the analysis of Hom s 4-specific cytokine and humoral immune responses indicated  that Hom s 4 strongly induces Th1 responses which are accompanied by the release  of IFN-gamma, a cytokine implicated in epithelial cell damage. Hom s 4-induced IFN-gamma production was found in normal individuals, in patients with chronic inflammatory skin diseases and in Th2-prone atopic persons, suggesting that Hom s 4 represents a protein with an intrinsic property to induce Th1-mediated autoreactivity. It may thus contribute to chronic skin inflammation in atopic as  well as in nonatopic persons.  	16002733

Wittmann M(1), Purwar R, Hartmann C, Gutzmer R, Werfel T.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology and Allergology, Hannover Medical University, Hannover, Germany. wittman.mariam@mh-hannover.de  Interleukin (IL)-18 has been described to play a role in several inflammatory skin diseases such as eczema and psoriasis. In this study, we aimed to elucidate  keratinocytes as potential targets for IL-18 effects. In human primary keratinocytes expression of IL-18Ralpha as well as responses to IL-18 were determined. In keratinocytes freshly isolated from skin biopsies of lesional atopic dermatitis or psoriasis, we observed a significantly higher expression of  the IL-18Ralpha as compared with keratinocytes from normal donors. A marked upregulation was induced in vitro upon stimulation with interferon (IFN)gamma+tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha or poly I:C. IL-4 led to downregulation of IL-18Ralpha. IL-18-induced CXCL10/IP-10 production in freshly isolated keratinocytes from lesional psoriasis as well as in cultured normal keratinocytes. Furthermore, IL-18 upregulated major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression on IFNgamma-stimulated keratinocytes. This was of functional significance as verified in coculture experiments with CD4+ T cells in the presence of superantigen. T cells produced significant amounts of IFNgamma after coculture with IL-18-induced MHC class II expressing keratinocytes. In conclusion, we have shown that keratinocytes functionally respond to IL-18 with upregulation of MHC II and production of the chemokine CXCL10/IP-10. These findings further support an important role of IL-18 in inflammatory skin diseases in the epidermal compartment.  DOI: 10.1111/j.0022-202X.2005.23715.x 	15955098

Prominent involvement of activated Th1-subset of T-cells and increased expression of receptor for IFN-gamma on keratinocytes in atopic dermatitis acute skin lesions.  Lugović L(1), Lipozencić J, Jakić-Razumović J.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology and Venereology, University Hospital 'Sestre milosrdnice', Zagreb, Croatia. liborija@yahoo.com  BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an allergic skin disease mediated by antigen-specific IgE and an important role has been ascribed to CD4+ cells (Th cells). The objective of the study was to evaluate humoral and cellular immunological factors in the blood and the skin lesions of AD patients, and to analyze the presence of inflammatory cell-surface markers in blood and skin biopsies. METHODS: The parameters for monitoring of 40 AD patients included results of prick test to inhalant allergens and epicutaneous (patch) test to contact allergens; values of total IgE, serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM) and different cell markers in the sera (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD21, CD23, HLA-DR). We  also analyzed the presence of inflammatory cell-surface markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD20, CD1a, CD23, CD29, CD45Ro, IFNgamma+ markers) in the biopsies of skin  lesions from 10 AD patients and 5 healthy controls (HCs) by immunohistochemical analysis (method of avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase). RESULTS: Beside increased total serum IgE and positive skin tests, a significantly higher percentage of CD23+ cells with lower percentage of CD21+ cells was revealed in peripheral blood of AD patients in comparison to HCs. A positive epidermal expression of the majority of markers of T cells (CD3+, CD4+,  CD8+, CD29+, CD45Ro+, IFNgamma+) and those of Langerhans' cells (LCs) (CD1a, CD23+), without those of B cells (CD20+) were noted in AD patients, but no in the skin of HCs. Furthermore, significant difference was also found between the two groups for increased expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD29, CD45Ro, IFNgamma+ markers (markers for IFNgamma receptor) and higher intraepidermal CD23+ LCs and intradermal CD1a+ LCs in AD skin lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results suggest involvement of various humoral factors  with increased production of IgE and cooperation between Th subsets and LCs, with higher production of related cytokines, and disturbed cellular immunity, including epidermal LCs with IgE receptors of high and low affinity in AD. The annotation of activated Th1 cells with increased producing of IFNgamma in acute AD skin lesions is notable, and might lead to IFNgamma binding to keratinocytes and consequently inflammatory skin changes in the disease.

Watanabe N(1), Hanabuchi S, Marloie-Provost MA, Antonenko S, Liu YJ, Soumelis V.  Author information:  (1)DNAX Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA, USA.  Interleukin-4 (IL-4), a major T-helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine, primes dendritic cells (DCs) for IL-12 production, suggesting a negative feedback loop to prevent  dysregulated Th2 inflammation, such as allergy. We previously showed that human thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), highly expressed by keratinocytes of atopic  dermatitis, activates CD11c(+) DCs to induce the differentiation of naive CD4(+)  and CD8(+) T cells into proallergic effectors. Here we show that TSLP primes DCs  to produce large amounts of IL-12 after CD40 ligand stimulation, similar to IL-4  priming of DCs. In contrast to IL-4 priming, DCs activated with TSLP and CD40 ligand induce the differentiation of naive CD4(+) T cells into effectors producing both Th1 and Th2 cytokines, a unique profile that is reminiscent of the late phase of allergy. Thus, TSLP is a major regulatory cytokine for IL-12 production by DCs, and TSLP-activated DCs could promote the persistence of Th2 inflammation even in the presence of IL-12-inducing signals.

Bigliardi-Qi M(1), Lipp B, Sumanovski LT, Buechner SA, Bigliardi PL.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.  There is increasing evidence that neuropeptides such as a substance P, neurotrophins or beta-endorphin, an endogenous agonist for mu-opioid receptor, are involved in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis in which mental stress and  scratching deteriorate the disease. mu-Opioid receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor, can be downregulated and internalized by agonists and other factors in  vitro. In this study, we investigated the regulation of mu-opioid receptor and nerve endings in atopic dermatitis patients. Skin biopsies from atopic dermatitis patients revealed a significant downregulation of mu-opiate receptor expression in epidermis of atopic dermatitis. Permeabilization of the skin showed that the receptor in keratinocytes from atopic dermatitis is internalized. The mRNA expression pattern of the mu-opiate receptor is different in epidermis taken from patients with chronic atopic dermatitis compared to normal skin. In atopic dermatitis, the mRNA is concentrated in the subcorneal layers of the epidermis and in normal skin in the suprabasal layers. Staining of the nerve endings using  protein gene product 9.5 shows a different pattern of epidermal nerve endings in  normal skin compared to atopic dermatitis. In normal skin, the epidermal nerve endings are rather thick. However, in atopic dermatitis, the epidermal nerve endings are thin and run straight through the epidermis. Based on these observations and combining the 'intensity' and 'pattern' hypothesis, we propose a new theory especially for histamine-unrelated, peripheral induction of chronic pruritus. We suggest that 'itch' is elicited in the epidermal unmyelinated nerve  C-fibers and 'pain' in the dermal unmyelinated nerve fibers. The downregulation of the opioid receptor in the epidermis contributes to the chronic itching. We call this new hypothesis the 'layer hypothesis'.  DOI: 10.1159/000082563 	15724090

Keratinocyte-derived, CD80-mediated costimulation is associated with hapten-specific IgE production during contact hypersensitivity to TH1 haptens.  Burns R(1), Luzina I, Nasir A, Haidaris CG, Barth RK, Gaspari AA.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, USA.  Background B7-1 transgenic mice exhibit exaggerated and persistent contact hypersensitivity responses compared with normal mice. Objective Because B7-1 and  B7-2 deliver different costimulatory signals to T cells during antigen presentation, the purpose of this study was to compare B7-1 and B7-2 on keratinocytes and to compare their effects on contact hypersensitivity. Methods Contact hypersensitivity was studied in transgenic mice whose keratinocytes constitutively expressed B7-1, B7-2, or no costimulatory molecules (nontransgenic mice). Results B7-1 transgenic mice, and to a lesser extent B7-2 transgenic mice, developed exaggerated ear swelling responses after sensitization and challenge with haptens such as trinitrochlorobenzene or dinitrofluorobenzene. Ear swelling  responses in B7-1 transgenic mice were characterized by the presence of markedly  elevated inflammatory cytokine transcripts (IL-6, TNF-alpha, and lymphotoxin beta) as well as IL-10 compared with either B7-2 or nontransgenic mice. Hapten-specific IgE was detected by ELISA in B7-1 transgenic mice but not B7-2 transgenic or nontransgenic mice. Only B7-1 transgenic mice exhibited significant immediate type ear swelling responses to the hapten trinitrochlorobenzene. In addition, their sera can passively transfer cutaneous anaphylaxis to naive C57BL/6 mice, indicating that the hapten-specific IgE was relevant to the immediate ear swelling responses. Conclusion These data suggest that keratinocyte-derived costimulation mediated by B7-1 but not B7-2 results in the emergence of T H 2-lymphocyte immune responses to T H 1 haptens. Because human keratinocytes have been noted to express B7-1-like molecules in certain inflammatory skin diseases, this model may be important in understanding the pathophysiology of T H 2-lymphocyte-mediated skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis.

Agonists of proteinase-activated receptor-2 stimulate upregulation of intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 in primary human keratinocytes via activation of NF-kappa B.  Buddenkotte J(1), Stroh C, Engels IH, Moormann C, Shpacovitch VM, Seeliger S, Vergnolle N, Vestweber D, Luger TA, Schulze-Osthoff K, Steinhoff M.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology and Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cell Biology and  Immunobiology of the Skin, University of Münster, Münster, Germany.  Proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) belongs to a new G protein-coupled receptor subfamily that is activated by various serine proteases. Recent knowledge indicates that PAR2 is involved in cutaneous inflammation and immune response. PAR2 is highly expressed by human keratinocytes (KTC). The underlying mechanisms of PAR2-mediated KTC function and cutaneous immune response are, however, still incomplete. Therefore, we investigated the activation of important signaling cascades in primary human KTC after PAR2-stimulation using specific agonists. Moreover, we compared PAR2-immunoreactivity in the epidermis of inflammatory dermatoses and normal human skin. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and morphological transduction studies revealed PAR2-induced activation and translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) in primary human KTC with a maximum after 1 h. Supershift analysis demonstrated acivation of the p50/p65 heterodimer complex. PAR2 agonists also induced upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) RNA, as shown by RT-PCR. Use of NF-kappaB inhibitors prevented upregulation of the cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1 in KTC indicating a direct role of NF-kappaB in PAR2-mediated upregulation of ICAM-1. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis confirmed PAR2-induced and NF-kappaB-mediated upregulation of ICAM-1 protein after 13 h. Moreover, increased expression of PAR2 was detected in KTC of patients with atopic dermatitis suggesting a role of PAR2 in human skin inflammation. In conclusion, PAR2 induces upregulation of cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 in primary human KTC via NF-kappaB activation, and is upregulated in KTC during cutaneous inflammation. Thus, PAR2 may play an important regulatory role of human KTC during inflammation and immune response.  DOI: 10.1111/j.0022-202X.2004.23539.x 	15654951

Author information:  (1)Department of Pathology, Teikyo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. nmk@med.teikyo-u.ac.jp  BACKGROUND: The chemokine CCL27 attracts skin-homing T cells. CCL27 production by keratinocytes is enhanced in skin lesions from patients with atopic dermatitis or psoriasis vulgaris. It is suggested that prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) regulates skin inflammation. OBJECTIVE: We examined the in vitro effects of PGE(2) on CCL27 production in human keratinocytes. METHODS: Keratinocytes were incubated with TNF-alpha in the presence or absence of PGE(2) . CCL27 secretion and mRNA level were analyzed by means of ELISA and RT-PCR, respectively. Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent transcriptional activity was analyzed by using luciferase assays. RESULTS: TNF-alpha increased CCL27 secretion and mRNA levels in parallel to NF-kappaB activity in keratinocytes. NF-kappaB p50 or p65 antisense oligonucleotides suppressed TNF-alpha-induced CCL27 production, indicating the requirement of NF-kappaB for CCL27 production. PGE(2) , EP2, or EP3 agonists reduced TNF-alpha-induced CCL27 secretion and mRNA levels in parallel to NF-kappaB activity and CCL2, CCL5, CXCL8, and CXCL10 mRNA levels. Either EP3-specific or dual EP1-EP2 antagonist partially blocked the inhibitory effects  of PGE(2) on CCL27 production and NF-kappaB activity, and the addition of both completely abrogated the inhibition, whereas EP1 or EP4 antagonists were ineffective. Intracellular Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA/AM or cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase inhibitor H-89 partially blocked the inhibitory effects of PGE(2) on CCL27 production and NF-kappaB activity, and  the addition of both completely abrogated the inhibition. PGE(2) or EP3 agonist increased intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations. PGE(2) or EP2 agonist increased intracellular cAMP concentrations. CONCLUSION: PGE(2) might suppress CCL27 production by inhibiting NF-kappaB activity through EP2-mediated cAMP and EP3-mediated Ca(2+) signals. PGE 2 might terminate T cell-mediated skin inflammation by inhibiting CCL27 production.  DOI: 10.1016/j.jaci.2004.08.041 	15577845

Shiina T(1), Konno A, Oonuma T, Kitamura H, Imaoka K, Takeda N, Todokoro K, Morimatsu M.  Author information:  (1)Department of Veterinary Physiology, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Ueda 3-18-8, Morioka 020-8550, Japan.  MAIL (molecule-possessing ankyrin repeats induced by lipopolysaccharide) is a nuclear IkappaB protein that is also termed interleukin-1-inducible nuclear ankyrin repeat protein or inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaB (IkappaB) zeta. In this study, we generated Mail-/- mice to investigate the roles of MAIL in whole organisms. Mail-/- mice grew normally until 4-8 weeks after birth, when they began to develop lesions in the skin of the periocular region, face, and neck. MAIL mRNA and protein were constitutively expressed in the skin of wild type controls, especially in the keratinocytes. Serum IgE was higher in Mail-/- mice than in normal. Histopathological analysis indicated that the Mail-/- skin lesions appeared to be atopic dermatitis (AD) eczema with inflammatory cell infiltration. In addition, markedly elevated expression of some chemokines such as thymus and activation-regulated chemokine was detected in the Mail-/- skin lesions, similar to that observed in the skin of patients with AD. In Mail-/- mice, MAIL-deficient keratinocytes might be activated to produce chemokines and induce intraepidermal filtration of inflammatory cells, resulting in the onset of the AD-like disease. These findings suggest that MAIL is an essential molecule for homeostatic regulation of skin immunity. The Mail-/- mouse is a valuable new  animal model for research on AD.

Author information:  (1)Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Tufts University School of Medicine, 136 Harrison Avenue, Boston, MA 02111, USA. theoharis.theoharides@tufts.edu  Several inflammatory skin conditions, including atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis, are exacerbated by stress. Recent evidence suggests that crosstalk between mast cells, neurons and keratinocytes might be involved in such exacerbation. Mast cells are distributed widely in the skin, are present in increased numbers in AD and are located in close proximity to substance P- or neurotensin-containing neurons. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), its structurally related peptide urocortin (Ucn) and their receptors are also present in the skin and their levels are increased following stress. Human mast cells synthesize and secrete both CRF and Ucn in response to immunoglobulin E receptor  (FcepsilonRI) crosslinking. Mast cells also express CRF receptors, activation of  which leads to the selective release of cytokines and other pro-inflammatory mediators. Thus, we propose that CRF receptor antagonists could be used together  with natural molecules, such as retinol and flavonoids, to inhibit mast cell activation and provide new therapeutic options for chronic inflammatory conditions exacerbated by stress.

267. Br J Dermatol. 2004 Sep;151(3):534-9.	 Dermcidin is constitutively produced by eccrine sweat glands and is not induced in epidermal cells under inflammatory skin conditions.  Rieg S(1), Garbe C, Sauer B, Kalbacher H, Schittek B.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Eberhard-Karls-University Tübingen, Liebermeisterstr. 25, D-72076 Tübingen, Germany.  BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are important effector molecules of innate immunity, protecting epithelial surfaces of multicellular organisms. In human skin two classes of AMPs-the beta-defensins and the cathelicidins-are produced by keratinocytes primarily under inflammatory conditions. In contrast, dermcidin (DCD), a recently discovered AMP with broad-spectrum activity, is expressed in eccrine sweat glands and transported via sweat to the epidermal surface. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether DCD expression is induced under inflammatory conditions in epidermal keratinocytes. METHODS: Lesional skin of the inflammatory skin diseases atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and lichen planus was analysed by immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal anti-DCD antiserum. We also examined whether DCD RNA expression is induced in cultured human keratinocytes, fibroblasts, melanocytes and melanoma cells. RESULTS: Whereas DCD was constitutively expressed in eccrine sweat glands of all  skin biopsies, we found that, independent of the type of the inflammatory skin lesion, DCD protein expression was not induced in human epidermal keratinocytes.  In contrast, beta-defensin 2 was expressed in epidermal keratinocytes of inflammatory human skin, but not in keratinocytes of healthy human skin. Upon stimulation of the cultured cells with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, lipopolysaccharide or H2O2, DCD mRNA expression was not detected in primary keratinocytes, fibroblasts and melanocytes, but was detected in MeWo and SKMEL28 melanoma cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that, unlike human cathelicidins and beta-defensins which are inducible peptides that primarily function in response to injury and inflammation, DCD is exclusively part of the constitutive innate defence of human skin. By modulating surface colonization, DCD may help to prevent local and systemic invasion of pathogens.  DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2004.06081.x 	15377337

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Marselisborg Centret, Aarhus County Hospital, University of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark. Chr-vest@post9.tele.dk  Monocytes form a significant component of the inflammatory reaction taking place  in the skin of atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Chemokines are pivotal in mediating the attraction of leucocytes to sites of inflammation. The CC-chemokine, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1/CCL2), is expressed by keratinocytes in both atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. MCP-1 binds to the chemokine receptor CCR2 which is known to be expressed on monocytes and macrophages. We examined the expression of CCR2 on peripheral blood monocytes from patients with psoriasis (n=8) and atopic dermatitis (n=7) and found it to be expressed on approximately 90% of the cells, whereas monocytes from healthy donors had a significantly lower CCR2 expression (p<0.05). Skin biopsies from patients suffering from atopic dermatitis and psoriasis revealed that CCR2-positive cells expressed CD163, a marker for monocytes/macrophages. However, not all CD163-positive cells expressed CCR2, which could be interpreted as a mechanism for retaining the macrophages in the skin. Furthermore, we found that keratinocytes are able to express MCP-1, when stimulated with tumour necrosis factor-alpha and/or interferon-gamma in a dose-dependent manner. Thus MCP-1 and CCR2 interaction is likely of importance for the monocyte/macrophage trafficking  of inflammatory skin disorders.  DOI: 10.1080/00015550410034444 	15370700

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, The Marselisborg Centre, Aarhus County Hospital, University of Aarhus, Denmark. chr-vest@post9.tele.dk  Thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC)/CCL17 and cutaneous T cell-attracting chemokine (CTACK)/CCL27 are both pivotal mediators of the inflammatory reaction of atopic dermatitis (AD). TARC attracts CCR4 positive T cells known to be mainly of Th2 subtype whereas CTACK attracts skin-homing T cells of both Th1 and Th2 subtype that express CCR10. We found that CTACK can be  induced in cultured human keratinocytes by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), but not by TARC alone. However, if the keratinocytes were preincubated with TNF-a for 6 h, TARC was able to augment the CTACK-inducing effect of TNF-a. Performing immunohistochemical stainings, reverse-transcription  polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and Western blotting, we found that TNF-a-induced CCR4 mRNA production, but that stimulated as well as non-stimulated keratinocytes expressed CCR4. In order to see if these results had any clinical relevance, we investigated the plasma concentrations of TARC and CTACK from 48 patients suffering from AD. This revealed that TARC and CTACK concentrations in plasma correlate with each other. Surprisingly, p-CTACK correlated inversely with SCORAD scores of the patients, which most likely is due to the treatment the patients received. Our results suggest that the primary Th2-dominated inflammatory reaction in AD induced by TARC leads to an augmented skin-specific inflammatory reaction through CTACK.

Author information:  (1)Division of Clinical Immunology and Allergy, Johns Hopkins Asthma and Allergy  Center, Baltimore, MD 21224-6801, USA. lab@jhmi.edu  Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that usually predates the development of allergic airway disease. In most cases, this is thought to be an allergen-driven disease with prominent roles played by antigen presenting cells and effector Th2 cells. But keratinocytes, by virtue of their location, provide an important window to the environment and are also thought to  contribute to the development of AD. In this review, we discuss several biologic  attributes of keratinocytes that are relevant for AD: 1) intrinsic defects in barrier function, 2) production of inflammatory mediators that promote or maintain allergic inflammation, 3) keratinocyte apoptosis, 4) effects of staphylococcal toxins on keratinocytes, and 5) potential consequences of the expression of cosignaling molecules (eg, B7 family members) and receptors important for innate immune responses (eg, Toll receptors). Clearly, these findings have highlighted a more active role played by the epithelium than was previously recognized.  	15175141

Author information:  (1)Bayer Yakuhin, Ltd., Research Center Kyoto, Respiratory Disease Research, 6-5-1-3, Kunimidai, Kizu-cho, Soraku-gun, 619-0216 Kyoto, Japan.  Chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 lymphocytes, CRTH2, is a cognate receptor for prostaglandin (PG) D(2) and, in humans, is suggested to play a functional role in Th2-dependent allergic inflammation. While peripheral blood leukocytes expressing high levels of surface CRTH2 have been detected in disease, little is known of the functional significance of CRTH2 in disease etiology. We have utilized a Th2-dependent murine model of FITC-induced contact hypersensitivity to assess the role, if any, CRTH2-PGD(2) may play in the elicitation or maintenance of such pathobiology. Expression of both PGD(2) and CRTH2 in lesional skin was paralleled by the release of the chemoattractants LTB(4) and the chemokine KC, as well as a profuse dermal neutrophilic and eosinophilic infiltrate, closely paralleling the acute inflammatory pathology observed in human atopic dermatitis. A small molecule CRTH2 antagonist, but not a selective PGD(2)R (DP) receptor antagonist, was able to completely abrogate these responses. Inflammatory cascades mediated by CRTH2 ligation may therefore represent an important early step in the elicitation and maintenance of Th2-dependent skin inflammation.

We found that peptidoglycan (PGN) of Staphylococcus aureus, which is frequently observed in lesion with AD, induced the production of numerous mediators such as GM-CSF and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted. Moreover, PGN phosphorylated extracellular-signal-regulated kinases and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase,  which were involved in the induction of GM-CSF expression. These results suggested that PGN of S. aureus directly exacerbates inflammation of inflammatory skin disease.  DOI: 10.1016/j.febslet.2004.04.028 	15147894

Mast cell-derived histamine contributes to the cross-talk between mast cells and keratinocytes. We examined the effects of histamine on GM-CSF production in human keratinocytes. Histamine increased GM-CSF secretion, mRNA stability and promoter  activity. Activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) elements on the promoter were responsible for the activation by histamine. Histamine enhanced transcriptional activity and DNA binding of AP-1 and NF-kappaB. Histamine shifted AP-1 composition form c-Jun homodimers to c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers, and transiently expressed c-Fos protein. Histamine rapidly induced the phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitory kappaB. Histamine induced membrane translocation of protein kinase Calpha. Histamine-induced GM-CSF production was completely abolished by H1 antagonist pyrilamine and conventional protein kinase C inhibitor Gö6976, and partially suppressed by PD98059 which inhibits the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Gö6976 and PD98059 suppressed histamine-induced c-Fos expression and AP-1 activation. Gö6976 and PD98059 suppressed histamine-induced enhancement of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. Histamine-induced phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitory kappaB was suppressed by Gö6976, but not by PD98059. These results suggest that histamine may enhance GM-CSF production at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels via H1 receptor, protein kinase Calpha and extracellular signal-regulated kinase.

Vestergaard C(1), Deleuran M, Gesser B, Larsen CG.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Marselisborg Research Center, Research Laboratory D, Aarhus, Denmark. chr-vest@post9.tele.dk  TARC/CCL17 (thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine) is a CC chemokine, which  binds to the CC chemokine receptor-4 (CCR4) known to be distinctively expressed on Th2 lymphocytes. In atopic dermatitis (AD), the skin is invaded by Th2 lymphocytes in the acute phase. TARC/CCL17 is produced by the keratinocytes in AD lesions, and CCR4 is overexpressed on CLA+ (cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen) lymphocytes in the skin and blood. We, therefore, hypothesized that TARC/CCL17 is pivotal in mediating a Th2-dominated inflammation in the skin. To examine this, we injected BALB/c mice with murine TARC/CCL17 in concentrations ranging from 0.1 microg/ml to 10 microg/ml and examined the skin after 48 h. This revealed that TARC/CCL17 induces lymphocytic infiltration of the skin by CD4+ lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum response at 1 microg/ml. Additionally, TARC/CCL17 induced interleukin-4 mRNA but not interferon-gamma mRNA expression in the skin, suggesting that the lymphocytes invading the skin are Th2 cells. Additionally, TARC/CCL17 induced its own production in the keratinocytes along with cutaneous T-cell-attracting chemokine (CTACK/CCL27) mRNA. We, therefore, conclude that TARC/CCL17 induces a Th2-dominated inflammatory reaction when injected into the skin.  DOI: 10.1111/j.0906-6705.2004.00149.x 	15086343

Author information:  (1)Klinik für Dermatologie, Venerologie und Allergologie des Universitätsklinikums Mannheim. Hjalmar.Kurzen@haut.ma.uni-heidelberg.de  Acetylcholine (ACh) is a prototypical neurotransmitter that has recently been recognized to occur extraneuronally in a large variety of cells. ACh and its nicotinic and muscarinic receptors are produced in the epidermis and in the adnexal structures of the skin in a highly complicated pattern. They are also produced in melanocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and immune cells. Through autocrine, paracrine and endocrine mechanisms, the cholinergic system is involved in the basic functions of the skin, such as keratinocyte differentiation, epidermal barrier formation, sweating, sebum production, blood circulation, angiogenesis and a variety of immune reactions. Hence diseases like acne vulgaris, vitiligo, psoriasis, pemphigus vulgaris and atopic dermatitis may be influenced. The exploration of the extraneuronal cholinergic system of the skin has only just begun.  DOI: 10.1007/s00105-004-0724-5 	15067414

Author information:  (1)Kao Biological Science Laboratories, Akabane Ichikai, Haga, Tochigi, Japan. imokawag@dream.ocn.ne.jp  Recently melanogenic paracrine or autocrine cytokine networks have been discovered in vitro between melanocytes and other types of skin cells. These include endothelin (ET)-1, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, membrane-type stem cell factor (SCF) and growth-related oncogene-alpha for interactions between keratinocytes and melanocytes, and hepatocyte growth factor  and soluble type SCF for interactions between fibroblasts and melanocytes. These  networks are also associated with corresponding receptors expressed on melanocytes, including ET B receptor and the SCF receptor, c-KIT. Consistent with in vitro findings on the melanogenic paracrine or autocrine cytokine networks, we have found that the up- or down-regulation of such networks is intrinsically involved in vivo in the stimulation of melanocyte functions in several epidermal  hyper- or hypo-pigmentary disorders. These are ET-1/ET B receptor as well as membrane type SCF/c-KIT for ultraviolet B-melanosis, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor for ultraviolet A-melanosis, ET-1/ET B receptor as well as membrane type SCF for lentigo senilis, growth related oncogene-alpha for Riehl's melanosis, sphingosylphosphorylcholine for hyperpigmentation in atopic dermatitis, ET-1 for seborrhoeic keratosis, soluble type SCF as well as hepatocyte growth factor for dermatofibroma and café-au-lait macules, and c-KIT for vitiligo vulgaris. These unveiled regulatory mechanisms involved in the abnormal up- or down-regulated levels of lesional melanocyte function provide new insights into therapeutic tools utilizing blockage of responsible cytokine networks.

Donnarumma G(1), Paoletti I, Buommino E, Orlando M, Tufano MA, Baroni A.  Author information:  (1)Department of Experimental Medicine: Microbiology and Clinical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, Second University of Naples, Via Costantinopoli  16, 80138 Naples, Italy.  Antimicrobial peptides of the beta-defensin family are expressed in all human epithelial tissues tested to date and have recently been the subject of vigorous  investigation. Their localization and characteristics support the hypothesis that these peptides play a role in mucosal and skin defense. The lipophilic yeast Malassezia furfur is a saprophyte found in normal human cutaneous flora. Malassezia furfur is not only a saprophyte, but is also associated with several diseases such as Malassezia folliculitis, seborrheic dermatitis and some forms of atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and confluent and reticulate papillomatosis. Little  is known about the mechanism by which M. furfur overcomes the natural barrier of  the skin. To further define the role of the beta-defensins in the innate human skin immune response, we analyzed the mRNA expression of two human beta-defensins HBD-1 and HBD-2 in human keratinocytes treated with M. furfur. In addition, we looked into how M. furfur of TGF-beta1 and IL-10, cytokines that interfere with the development of protective cell immunity, regulate their expression. Finally,  we examined the signal transduction mechanisms involved during M. furfur uptake.  Cultured human keratinocytes were treated with M. furfur. The mRNA and protein expression were analyzed, respectively, by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting. Our data demonstrate that M. furfur does  not modify HBD-1 expression, whereas it up-regulates, via protein kinase C (PKC), the expression of HBD-2, TGFbeta-1 and IL-10 48 h after treatment. Our results suggest that beta-defensins are integral components of innate host defenses. They play an essential part in the resistance of the human skin surfaces against M. furfur uptake and other microbial invasion.  DOI: 10.1007/s00403-003-0445-0 	14963722

Author information:  (1)Department of Immunodermatology and Allergology, Istituto Dermopatico dell' Immacolata-IRCCS, Rome, Italy. p.amerio@idi.it  Cell migration is mediated by a group of chemotactic cytokines called chemokines: low molecular weight molecules that have been shown as important leukocyte chemical attractants to sites of inflammation and infection. Eotaxin-1, also called CCL11, was first described in 1994, as a highly specific eosinophils chemokine. Many cell types including lymphocytes, macrophages, bronchial smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and eosinophils, are able to produce this chemokine, predominantly after cytokine stimulation, however little is known about its expression in human skin in vivo. Eotaxin-1 also regulates the chemiotaxis and, in some conditions, activation of basophils, mast cells and T lymphocytes. Chemokine receptors are named from their ligand families, thus the CC chemokine eotaxin-1 binds to the CCR3 receptor which is expressed on eosinophis, mast cells, Th2 type lymphocytes and even on keratinocytes. It seems  that eotaxin-1 is one of the most important cytokines involved in tissue inflammation playing a central role in the pathogenesis of allergic airway diseases (asthma and rhinitis), in inflammatory bowel disease and gastrointestinal allergic hypersensitivity and recently it has been proposed as a therapeutical target for these conditions. Our group has studied the role of eotaxin-1 in the pathogenesis of two skin conditions: dermatitis herpetiformis and AIDS-associated eosinophilic folliculitis, demonstrating that this chemokine, together with Th2 type cytokines (IL-13 and IL-4) is important in cell recruitment, inflammation and tissue damage; moreover eotaxin has proven to paly  an important role in other skin conditions such as, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigoid gestationis, atopic dermatitis and allergic drug reactions Recent advances in the understanding of eotaxin-1-mediated mechanisms of chemotaxis in allergic and inflammatory conditions may predict that therapeutic antagonism is achievable. This paper will focus on the role that eotaxin and its receptor play  in the pathogenetical mechanism in a number of dermatologic diseases, some of which, like atopic dermatitis, may benefit from the introduction of novel and more selective therapeutic options.  	14561178
280. J Dermatol Sci. 2003 Oct;33(1):31-40.	 Up-regulation of interleukin-13 receptor alpha1 on human keratinocytes in the skin of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.  Wongpiyabovorn J(1), Suto H, Ushio H, Izuhara K, Mitsuishi K, Ikeda S, Nakao A, Okumura K, Ogawa H.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, 2-1-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8421, Japan.  BACKGROUND: Interleukin (IL)-13 is a pleiotropic cytokine, which shares many biological functions with IL-4. The receptor subunits of IL-13 consist of IL-4Ralpha, IL-13Ralpha1 and IL-13Ralpha2. The regulatory mechanisms of the IL-13Ralpha expression in the keratinocytes of certain skin disease have not been known. OBJECTIVE: To clear the roles of IL-13 and the regulatory mechanisms of its receptor in atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis. METHOD: The expression of IL-13Ralpha1 in the skin of AD and psoriasis was investigated by immunohistochemistry. The regulation of IL-13Ralpha mRNA in the skin and human primary keratinocyte (HPK) was investigated by quantitative PCR. The secretion of IL-6 and RANTES from HPK was measured by ELISA. RESULTS: The expression of IL-13Ralpha1 was more prominent on the suprabasal keratinocytes in the skin of AD and striking increase of staining was observed on all layers of keratinocyte in the skin of psoriasis. The mRNA of IL-13Ralpha1, but not of IL-13Ralpha2 was overexpressed in both skin of AD and psoriasis. In vitro experiment using HPK demonstrated that IFN-gamma, IL-13 but not IL-4 could  up-regulate the mRNA expression of IL-13Ralpha1. In contrast, IL-13Ralpha2 mRNA expression was up-regulated by IFN-gamma plus IL-4. Furthermore, the stimulation  of HPK with IFN-gamma plus IL-13 and/or IL-4 resulted in significant enhancement  of IL-6 and RANTES secretion. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that IL-4 and IL-13 have different regulatory effects on the expression of IL-13Ralpha1 and alpha2, and the overexpression of IL-13Ralpha1 may play some roles in the pathogenesis of chronic stage of AD or psoriasis.  	14527737
281. Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol. 2003 Oct;3(5):353-8.	 Dendritic cells and atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome.  von Bubnoff D(1), Koch S, Bieber T.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Friedrich-Wilhelms-University, Bonn, Germany.  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The manifestation of atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome is believed to result from a complex interrelationship of environmental factors, pharmacological abnormalities, skin barrier defects, and immunological phenomena. Although we are only beginning to understand the molecular basis of this disease, much progress has been made in defining key events leading to the manifestation of allergic inflammation. Here, we review recent findings that underscore the importance of dendritic cells as being central to shape these proinflammatory responses. RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence for a differential regulation of the high affinity receptor for IgE, Fc epsilon RI, on the surface of atopic dendritic cells compared with non-atopic dendritic cells became apparent. In atopic donors, in contrast to non-atopic donors, the intracellular expression of the gamma-chains of Fc epsilon RI is sufficient, thus leading to the assembly with the alpha-chain and surface expression of the receptor. This finding is of considerable interest  for an understanding of the pathophysiology of IgE-mediated dendritic cell functions in atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome. In addition, it has been shown that keratinocytes from the epidermal skin of individuals with atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome express human thymic stromal lymphopoietin, which activates dendritic cells to attract T helper type 2 cells into the skin. Furthermore, these activated dendritic cells prime naïve T cells into T helper type 2 cells. SUMMARY: The past few years have seen a remarkable process of refocusing in atopy. Dendritic cells in particular have been at the centre of this process. It  has become unequivocally clear that these cells have the power of shaping the allergic response.

Nomura I(1), Goleva E, Howell MD, Hamid QA, Ong PY, Hall CF, Darst MA, Gao B, Boguniewicz M, Travers JB, Leung DY.  Author information:  (1)Department of Pediatrics, National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver, CO 80206, USA.  Atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis are the two most common chronic skin diseases. However patients with AD, but not psoriasis, suffer from frequent skin  infections. To understand the molecular basis for this phenomenon, skin biopsies  from AD and psoriasis patients were analyzed using GeneChip microarrays. The expression of innate immune response genes, human beta defensin (HBD)-2, IL-8, and inducible NO synthetase (iNOS) was found to be decreased in AD, as compared with psoriasis, skin (HBD-2, p = 0.00021; IL-8, p = 0.044; iNOS, p = 0.016). Decreased expression of the novel antimicrobial peptide, HBD-3, was demonstrated  at the mRNA level by real-time PCR (p = 0.0002) and at the protein level by immunohistochemistry (p = 0.0005). By real-time PCR, our data confirmed that AD,  as compared with psoriasis, is associated with elevated skin production of Th2 cytokines and low levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-1beta. Because HBD-2, IL-8, and iNOS are known to be inhibited  by Th2 cytokines, we examined the effects of IL-4 and IL-13 on HBD-3 expression in keratinocyte culture in vitro. We found that IL-13 and IL-4 inhibited TNF-alpha- and IFN-gamma-induced HBD-3 production. These studies indicate that decreased expression of a constellation of antimicrobial genes occurs as the result of local up-regulation of Th2 cytokines and the lack of elevated amounts of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma under inflammatory conditions in AD skin. These observations could explain the increased susceptibility of AD skin to microorganisms, and suggest a new fundamental rule that may explain the mechanism for frequent infection in other Th2 cytokine-mediated diseases.  	12960356

A second step of chemotaxis after transendothelial migration: keratinocytes undergoing apoptosis release IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10, monokine induced by  IFN-gamma, and IFN-gamma-inducible alpha-chemoattractant for T cell chemotaxis toward epidermis in atopic dermatitis.  Klunker S(1), Trautmann A, Akdis M, Verhagen J, Schmid-Grendelmeier P, Blaser K,  Akdis CA.  Author information:  (1)Swiss Institute of Allergy and Asthma Research, Davos, Switzerland.  Activation and skin-selective homing of T cells and their effector functions in the skin represent sequential immunological events in the pathogenesis of atopic  dermatitis (AD). Apoptosis of keratinocytes, induced mainly by T cells and mediated by IFN-gamma and Fas, is the essential pathogenetic event in eczema formation. Keratinocyte apoptosis appears as activation-induced cell death in AD. By IFN-gamma stimulation, chemokines such as IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10, monokine induced by IFN-gamma, and IFN-gamma-inducible alpha-chemoattractant are  strongly up-regulated in keratinocytes. These chemokines attract T cells bearing  the specific receptor CXCR3, which is highly expressed on T cells isolated from skin biopsies of AD patients. Accordingly, an increased T cell chemotaxis was observed toward IFN-gamma-treated keratinocytes. Supporting these findings, enhanced IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10, monokine induced by IFN-gamma, and IFN-gamma-inducible alpha-chemoattractant expression was observed in lesional AD  skin by immunohistochemical staining. These results indicate a second step of chemotaxis inside the skin after transendothelial migration of the inflammatory cells. Keratinocytes undergoing apoptosis in acute eczematous lesions release chemokines that attract more T cells toward the epidermis, which may further augment the inflammation and keratinocyte apoptosis.  	12847282

Mascia F(1), Mariani V, Girolomoni G, Pastore S.  Author information:  (1)Laboratory of Immunology, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carottere Scientifico, Rome, Italy.  During inflammatory skin disorders such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and allergic contact dermatitis, epidermal keratinocytes overexpress large amounts of soluble epidermal growth factor receptor ligands in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma. These cytokines also promote de novo synthesis of numerous chemokines, including CCL2/MCP-1, CCL5/RANTES, CXCL10/IP-10, and CXCL8/IL-8, in turn responsible for the recruitment of different leukocyte populations. This study demonstrates that stimulation of EGFR down-regulates CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10, while it increases CXCL8 expression in keratinocytes. Conversely, EGFR signaling blockade produces opposite effects, with increased CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10, and reduced CXCL8 expression. In a mouse model of contact hypersensitivity, a single topical administration of a selective EGFR kinase blocker before antigen challenge results in a markedly enhanced immune response with increased chemokine expression and heavier inflammatory cell infiltrate. Targeting EGFR on epithelial cells may thus have profound impact on inflammatory  and immune responses.  DOI: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63654-1  PMCID: PMC1868171	12819035

Author information:  (1)Department of Immunology & Medical Zoology, Second Department of Surgery, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya 663-8501, Japan. nakaken@hyo-med.ac.jp  After exposure of the skin to microbes, the host develops skin-specific inflammation and an acquired immune response, in which keratinocytes (KC) and Langerhans cells play critical roles respectively. We established two animal models. (i) We examined the importance of KC-derived IL-18 for the systemic IgE response by using a skin transplantation model. As previously reported, transgenic mice (KCASP1Tg), that over-express caspase-1 in their KC, display high serum levels of IgE, and spontaneously develop chronic dermatitis by production of IL-18 and IL-1beta. We examined the capacity of transplantation of cutaneous lesions from KCASP1Tg to induce IgE production in wild-type or mutant mice with a syngeneic background. Transplantation of active cutaneous lesions, that expressed high levels of IL-18 and IL-1beta, induced long-lasting IgE production in wild-type mice without elevation of circulating IL-18 and IL-1beta. Furthermore,  IL-18R-, CD4- or stat6-deficient mice transplanted with the lesions did not produce IgE, indicating that this IgE response is initiated by IL-18, and dependent on host-derived CD4(+) T cells and stat6. (ii) We investigated IL-18 secretion from KC upon stimulation with microbe products. Freshly isolated KC from wild-type mice secreted IL-18 in response to Protein A purified from Cowan 1 strain of Staphylococcus aureus (SpA), which often exacerbates human skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis. Cutaneous application of SpA increased serum levels of IL-18 and IgE. These results indicate that local accumulation of  IL-18 triggers systemic IgE responses without exposure to antigen.  	12697661

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, Japan.  Thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17) and its receptor, CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4), have been proven to be involved in a number of allergic diseases, especially atopic dermatitis (AD). The purpose of this study was to examine the expression and distribution of TARC and CCR4 mRNAs in samples  of AD (n=15, acute lesions 8, chronic lesions 7) and normal skin (n=6). The expression and distribution of TARC and CCR4 mRNAs were detected with the in situ reverse transcription (RT) -polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. TARC mRNA  was expressed in epidermal keratinocytes, dermal endothelial cells and infiltrating cells. CCR4 mRNA was expressed in dermal endothelial cells and infiltrating cells. In acute AD lesional skin, there were more positive cells, and the staining intensity was stronger than in chronic lesions (p<0.05). The distribution of positive cells was as follows: In the epidermis, keratinocytes in the basal layer showed the strongest staining, and keratinocytes in the spinous layer showed moderate staining; the superficial area showed faint staining. In the dermis, infiltrating cells located in the superficial area of the dermis showed the strongest staining, positive staining intensity became weaker and the  percentage of positive cells became less as the location became deeper. There were no positive cells in normal skin. These data further substantiate the role of TARC/CCR4 in the pathogenesis of AD.  	12598706

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical School, School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan. kwackie@jichi.ac.jp  Stem cell factor can induce mast cell proliferation and melanocyte activation. Vasoactive intestinal peptide has been suggested to play a part in inflammatory dermatoses, such as atopic dermatitis. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible role of stem cell factor in atopic dermatitis by analyzing epidermal stem cell factor production induced by vasoactive intestinal peptide and cytokines. Full-length type stem cell factor transcript was detected in normal human epidermal keratinocytes, and a human epidermal keratinocyte cell line DJM-1, as well as normal human dermal fibroblasts, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Spliced-type stem cell factor transcript was detected in both DJM-1 cells and normal human epidermal keratinocytes. Western blot analysis with stem cell factor antibody revealed a protein of the known molecular size of membrane-bound stem cell factor in the lysates of all three cell types. Stem cell factor immunoreactivity was found in the cytoplasm and the membrane of both DJM-1 cells and normal human epidermal keratinocytes using confocal laser scanning microscope. We examined the effects of vasoactive intestinal peptide and cytokines on stem cell factor production of DJM-1 cells using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Stem cell factor contents significantly increased in culture supernatants of DJM-1 cells treated with 1000 nm vasoactive  intestinal peptide and/or cytokines, including interleukins 4 and 13, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma. Overall, these results suggest that  several inflammatory cytokines (T helper 1 and 2) and vasoactive intestinal peptide from mast cells and nerve endings are capable of inducing stem cell factor production from epidermal keratinocytes in atopic dermatitis.

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine and  Dentistry, 2-5-1 Shikata-cho, Okayama 700-8558, Japan. wookkang@cc.okayama-u.ac.jp  Defensins are cationic antimicrobial peptides with a broad spectrum. Recently human beta-defensin 2 (hBD-2) has been isolated from psoriatic skin; however, its exact localization and fate have not been fully understood. We studied the distribution pattern of hBD-2 in skin tissues of psoriasis and other inflammatory skin diseases. In the upper spinous and granular layer of psoriasis vulgaris hBD-2 was present in the cytoplasm. In the horny layer the positive signals were  in a basket-weave pattern, indicating possible accumulation of hBD-2 in the intercellular space. The similar pattern of hBD-2 distribution was observed in the lesions of nummular eczema and atopic dermatitis. hBD-2 was not detected in the section of normal elbow and knee skin. When isolated psoriatic scales were stained, hBD-2 was detected in a wrapping paper-like distribution pattern surrounding the corneocytes. In horny layer of psoriatic skin hBD-2 was closely associated or colocalized with elafin, which is known to be in extracellular space, as demonstrated by double staining. Western blot analysis using cultured human keratinocytes detected hBD-2 with an expected size in the conditioned medium and in the cell lysates when stimulated with 5% FCS or IL-alpha. These results indicate that hBD-2 was synthesized and remained in cytoplasm in the upper spinous and granular layer, and then secreted into intercellular space in the horny layer. This dynamic change in hBD-2 distribution in epidermis is certainly relevant to function as an innate host defense mechanism against invading micro-organisms.

BACKGROUND: The innate immune system of human skin contains antimicrobial peptides known as cathelicidins (LL-37) and beta-defensins. In normal skin these  peptides are negligible, but they accumulate in skin affected by inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis. We compared the levels of expression of LL-37 and human beta-defensin 2 (HBD-2) in inflamed skin from patients with atopic dermatitis and from those with psoriasis. METHODS: The expression of LL-37 and HBD-2 protein in skin-biopsy specimens from  patients with psoriasis, patients with atopic dermatitis, and normal subjects was determined by immunohistochemical analysis. The amount of antimicrobial peptides  in extracts of skin samples was also analyzed by immunodot blot analysis (for LL-37) and Western blot analysis (for HBD-2). Quantitative, real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays were used to confirm the relative expression of HBD-2 and LL-37 messenger RNA (mRNA) in the skin-biopsy specimens. These peptides were also tested for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus with the use of a colony-forming assay. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the presence of abundant LL-37 and HBD-2 in the superficial epidermis of all patients with psoriasis. In comparison, immunostaining for these peptides was significantly decreased in acute and chronic lesions from patients with atopic dermatitis (P=0.006 and P=0.03, respectively). These results were confirmed by immunodot blot and Western blot analyses. Real-time RT-PCR showed significantly lower expression of HBD-2 mRNA and LL-37 mRNA in atopic lesions than in psoriatic lesions (P=0.009 and P=0.02, respectively). The combination of LL-37 and HBD-2 showed synergistic antimicrobial activity by effectively killing S. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: A deficiency in the expression of antimicrobial peptides may account for the susceptibility of patients with atopic dermatitis to skin infection with  S. aureus.

290. J Autoimmun. 2002 Jun;18(4):299-309.	 A highly sensitive and simple assay for the detection of circulating autoantibodies against full-length bullous pemphigoid antigen 180.  Schmidt E(1), Kromminga A, Mimietz S, Leinfelder U, Sitaru C, Bröcker EB, Zillikens D, Zimmermann U.  Author information:  (1)Department of Biotechnology, Biocenter, University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany.  Bullous pemphigoid antigen 180 (BP180) is the target of autoantibodies in various subepidermal blistering diseases. The most common one is bullous pemphigoid (BP). The pathological importance of anti-BP180 antibodies has been demonstrated in a passive transfer mouse model. However, sensitive assays for routinely detecting circulating antibodies directed against both intra- and extracellular domains of  BP180 are only available in specialized laboratories. In addition, most current assays use prokaryotic recombinant fragments of BP180 that lack conformation-dependent epitopes. A simple and very sensitive immunofluorescence (IF) assay based on eukaryotic cells is described here. Sf21 insect cells were transfected with full-length (FL) BP180. As revealed by FACS and confocal laser scanning microscopy the protein was expressed as type II transmembrane protein as in human keratinocytes. By testing serial dilutions of BP180-specific mouse monoclonal antibodies, the eukaryotic IF assay was demonstrated to be more sensitive compared to conventional assays including (1) indirect IF microscopy of human salt-split skin, (2) Western blotting (WB) of the keratinocyte-derived BP180 ectodomain, (3) WB of recombinant BP180 NC16A, and (4) WB of FL-BP180 extracted from Sf21 insect cells. When applied to sera from patients with BP (n = 65), pemphigoid gestationis (n = 16), and cicatricial pemphigoid (n = 7), the novel assay revealed that 58 (89%), 13 (81%), and 6 (84%), respectively, were positive. In contrast, all control sera (pemphigus, n = 20; epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, n = 5; anti-laminin 5 cicatricial pemphigoid, n = 5; systemic lupus erythematosus, n = 5; atopic dermatitis, n = 7; contact dermatitis, n = 3; normal human sera, n = 30) were negative indicating that the assay is highly specific. In addition, reactivity of the assay was conserved to a large extent when the cells had been stored at -20 degrees C for 3 months. Thus, this assay meets the demands of a simple and effective diagnostic tool for detecting circulating antibodies against FL-BP180 and may also be used in laboratories without access to molecular biological technology.  	12144811

Federici M(1), Giustizieri ML, Scarponi C, Girolomoni G, Albanesi C.  Author information:  (1)Laboratory of Immunology, Istituto Dermopatico dell' Immacolata, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Rome, Italy.  Keratinocytes contribute relevantly to the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases by expressing a variety of proinflammatory molecules, with T cell-derived IFN-gamma being the most potent keratinocyte activator. Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)1 and SOCS3 are negative regulators of IFN-gamma signaling and are induced in many cell types by IFN-gamma itself or by other cytokines. We show in this work that SOCS1, SOCS2, SOCS3, and cytokine-inducible  SH2-containing protein mRNA were up-regulated by IFN-gamma in normal human keratinocytes, whereas only SOCS1 or SOCS1 and cytokine-inducible SH2-containing  protein were induced by TNF-alpha or IL-4, respectively. SOCS1, SOCS2, and SOCS3  proteins were undetectable in healthy skin and highly expressed in the epidermis  of psoriasis and allergic contact dermatitis, but were only weakly expressed in atopic dermatitis skin. In keratinocytes transiently transfected with SOCS1 or SOCS3 the IFN-gamma-induced transactivation of an IFN-gamma-responsive reporter gene was markedly inhibited. SOCS1 and SOCS3 overexpression in keratinocyte stable clones inhibited IFN-gamma-induced phosphorylation of IFN-gammaR(alpha) and activation of STAT1 and STAT3. Furthermore, SOCS1 and, to a lesser extent, SOCS3 reduced membrane expression of ICAM-1 and HLA-DR, and release of IFN-gamma-inducible protein-10, monokine induced by IFN-gamma, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 by keratinocyte clones promoted by IFN-gamma. SOCS1-expressing keratinocytes showed constitutively higher, but not IFN-gamma-inducible, IL-8 levels compared with SOCS2 and SOCS3 clones, and were resistant to IFN-gamma-mediated growth inhibition. Targeting keratinocyte SOCS1 may represent a novel therapeutic approach to IFN-gamma-dependent skin diseases.  	12077274

Schmuth M(1), Neyer S, Rainer C, Grassegger A, Fritsch P, Romani N, Heufler C.  Author information:  (1)Departments of Dermatology, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria. matthias.schmuth@uibk.ac.at  External assault to the skin is followed by an epidermal response including synthesis of DNA, lipids, cytokines and migration of antigen presenting cells. MIP-3 alpha (CCL20, LARC, Exodus-1, Scya20) is a recently described C-C chemokine, predominantly expressed in extralymphoid tissue, which is known to direct migration of dendritic cell precursors and memory lymphocytes to sites of  antigen invasion. We assessed the expression of MIP-3 alpha in human skin using semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In vivo, MIP-3 alpha mRNA was constitutively expressed at low levels in untreated human epidermis. After acute  disruption of the epidermal permeability barrier MIP-3 alpha mRNA was upregulated in the epidermal fraction, whereas dermal MIP-3 alpha mRNA levels remained unchanged. In vitro, MIP-3 alpha was increased in cultured keratinocytes treated  with IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha and was present in immature and mature dendritic cells, THP-1 monocytic cells and activated T cells. Finally, skin biopsies from patients with psoriasis, contact dermatitis and mycosis fungoides showed abundant expression. In biopsies from atopic dermatitis and graft vs. host disease a weak  signal was present, whereas no expression was found in scleroderma and toxic epidermal necrolysis. We conclude that regulation of MIP-3 alpha mRNA is part of  the epidermal response to external assault. Its upregulation may represent a danger signal for increased immunosurveillance in barrier disrupted skin and inflammatory skin conditions with impaired barrier function to counteract potential antigen invasion.  	11994140

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, USA. jtravers@iupui.edu  Skin infections with Staphylococcus aureus are not only an important cause of morbidity and even mortality, but are thought to serve as initiation and/or persistance factors for numerous inflammatory skin diseases, including psoriasis  and atopic dermatitis. One mechanism by which S. aureus can modulate the immune system is through the production of proteins such as superantigenic toxins, Protein A, as well through the cytolytic alpha-toxin. This review serves to discuss the biology of these three types of proteins, with emphasis on their ability to stimulate the production of powerful pro-inflammatory lipid- and protein-derived cytokines in keratinocytes. Characterization of interactions between these proteins and the keratinocyte can provide a better understanding of how bacterial infection modulates inflammatory skin diseases, as well as provide  the basis for improved therapies involving antibacterial agents.

Author information:  (1)DNAX Research Institute, Palo Alto, California, USA. berhard.homey@uni-duesseldorf.de  Comment in     Nat Med. 2002 Feb;8(2):117-8.  The skin-associated chemokine CCL27 (also called CTACK, ALP and ESkine) and its receptor CCR10 (GPR-2) mediate chemotactic responses of skin-homing T cells in vitro. Here we report that most skin-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients suffering from psoriasis, atopic or allergic-contact dermatitis express CCR10. Epidermal basal keratinocytes produced CCL27 protein that bound to extracellular  matrix, mediated adhesion and was displayed on the surface of dermal endothelial  cells. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta induced CCL27 production whereas the glucocorticosteroid clobetasol propionate suppressed it. Circulating  skin-homing CLA+ T cells, dermal microvascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts  expressed CCR10 on their cell surface. In vivo, intracutaneous CCL27 injection attracted lymphocytes and, conversely, neutralization of CCL27-CCR10 interactions impaired lymphocyte recruitment to the skin leading to the suppression of allergen-induced skin inflammation. Together, these findings indicate that CCL27-CCR10 interactions have a pivotal role in T cell-mediated skin inflammation.  DOI: 10.1038/nm0202-157 	11821900
295. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2001 Nov;108(5):839-46.	 Targeting keratinocyte apoptosis in the treatment of atopic dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis.  Trautmann A(1), Akdis M, Schmid-Grendelmeier P, Disch R, Bröcker EB, Blaser K, Akdis CA.  Author information:  (1)Swiss Institute of Allergy and Asthma Research (SIAF), Davos, Switzerland.  BACKGROUND: Activation and skin-selective homing of T cells and effector functions in the skin represent sequential events in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis. OBJECTIVE: T cell-mediated keratinocyte apoptosis plays a key pathogenetic role in the formation of eczematous dermatitis. IFN-gamma released from activated T cells upregulates Fas on ke-ratinocytes, which renders them susceptible to apoptosis. The lethal hit is given to keratinocytes by means of Fas ligand expressed on the T-cell surface or released to the inflammatory microenvironment. We sought to investigate whether drugs used for the treatment of eczematous disorders interfere with this pathogenic pathway. METHODS: T cell-mediated, Fas-induced keratinocyte apoptosis in a keratinocyte-T  cell coculture system serves as an in vitro model of eczematous dermatitis. We tested, in this model, whether immunomodulatory agents (dexamethasone, cyclosporine A, rapamycine, tacrolimus/FK506, intravenous immunoglobulin [IVIG],  and theophylline) are able to inhibit apoptosis of keratinocytes. Additionally, skin biopsy specimens from patients with untreated and successfully treated eczematous dermatitis were evaluated for keratinocyte apoptosis. RESULTS: Dexamethasone, cyclosporine A, FK506, rapamycine, and IVIG are inhibitors of keratinocyte apoptosis induced by activated T cells. This effect is mediated by 2 major mechanisms directed on T cells or keratinocytes. T-cell activation was mainly inhibited by dexamethasone, FK506, cyclosporine A, and rapamycine. Interestingly, high-dose dexamethasone and IVIG directly inhibited Fas-mediated keratinocyte apoptosis. In vivo keratinocyte apoptosis was significantly reduced after successful topical treatment of eczematous lesions. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate mechanisms of action of current treatment approaches and provide a future for more focused therapeutic applications.  DOI: 10.1067/mai.2001.118796 	11692113

Baroni A(1), Perfetto B, Paoletti I, Ruocco E, Canozo N, Orlando M, Buommino E.  Author information:  (1)Istituto di Clinica Dermosifilopatica, Facoltà di Medicina e Chirurgia II, Università degli Studi di Napoli, Italy.  The lipophilic yeast Malassezia furfur is a member of the cutaneous microbiota, also associated with several chronic diseases such as pityriasis versicolor, folliculitis, seborrhoeic dermatitis, and some forms of atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and confluent and reticulate papillomatosis. In this study we determined the immunomodulatory and invasive capacity of M. furfur in a human keratinocyte cell culture, HaCat. At a yeast cell to HaCat ratio of 30:1, M. furfur penetration was only 30% with poor phagolysosome fusion and with cytoskeleton modification. Transglutaminase I gene expression was also inhibited, supporting the hypothesis that M. furfur causes an initial break in the barrier function of the epidermis. Moreover, we demonstrated that M. furfur modulates proinflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokine synthesis by downregulating IL-1alpha and by inhibiting IL-6 and TNF-alpha and by upregulating IL-10 and TGF-beta1. The suppressed inflammatory response induced by M. furfur may play a role in chronic disease.  	11686517

Author information:  (1)INSERM U346 and Department of Dermatology, Edouard Herriot Hospital, Lyon, France. laurent.misery@univ-st-etienne.fr  BACKGROUND: The expression of receptors for neuropeptides in the skin is modified in skin diseases. OBJECTIVE: We studied the cutaneous expression of substance P (SP) and somatostatin (SOM) receptors (SPR and SSTR, respectively) in skin affected by cutaneous inflammatory or tumoral T-cell infiltrates because these two neuropeptides are the ones most involved in inflammation. METHODS: We revealed expression of these receptors using a binding in situ technique that gave highly specific results. Skin biopsies were incubated with biotinylated neuropeptides (SP or SOM). RESULTS: In normal skin, SSTR were observed on blood vessels, smooth muscle fibres and sweat glands. SSTR expression was modified only when expressed by keratinocytes in Ofuji papuloerythroderma and by plasmocytes in plasmocytoma. SPR distribution was not modified in subjects with atopic dermatitis or lupus. The expression of SPR in the epidermis was diminished in Ofuji papuloerythroderma and parapsoriasis and absent in mycosis fungoides. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that malignant lymphocytic infiltrates can inhibit SPR expression on keratinocytes.  	11683288
298. Acta Odontol Scand. 2001 Jun;59(3):178-82.	 Cytokine network and dysregulated apoptosis in atopic dermatitis.  Akdis M(1), Trautmann A, Klunker S, Blaser K, Akdis CA.  Author information:  (1)Swiss Institute of Allergy and Asthma Research, Davos, Switzerland. akdisac@siaf.unizh.ch  Activation and skin-selective homing of peripheral blood memory/effector T cells  and effector functions in the skin represent sequential immunological events in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD). T cells infiltrating the skin utilize the cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA) and other receptors to recognize and cross the vascular endothelium. In the peripheral blood of AD patients, both CD4+ and CD8 subsets of CLA+CD45RO+ T cells are in an activated state with high CD25, HLA-DR, and CD40-ligand expression. They express upregulated Fas and Fas-ligand and undergo activation-induced apoptosis. After homing to skin these T cells form dermal infiltrates which play a key role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Skin-infiltrating T cells in AD are protected from activation-induced cell death, although they express both Fas and Fas-ligand. They are protected from apoptosis by cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, and IL-15 and  extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin and transferrin. CLA+, skin-homing T cells may play a role in peripheral blood eosinophilia and hyper IgE production by high IL-5 and IL-13 expression, respectively. These T cells secrete IFN-gamma in the skin, which upregulates Fas on keratinocytes and renders them susceptible to apoptosis. Keratinocyte apoptosis is induced by Fas-ligand, either soluble or expressed on the surface of T cells, leading to eczema formation. Here we discuss the mechanisms of skin-selective T cell homing and activation, and emphasize the concept of dysregulated apoptosis of T cells, eosinophils, and keratinocytes as essential pathogenetic episodes in AD and other eczematous disorders.  	11501888

Vasoactive intestinal peptide regulates its receptor expression and functions of  human keratinocytes via type I vasoactive intestinal peptide receptors.  Kakurai M(1), Fujita N, Murata S, Furukawa Y, Demitsu T, Nakagawa H.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan. kwackie@jichi.ac.jp  Vasoactive intestinal peptide has been suggested to play some roles in inflammatory dermatoses such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. The aim of this  study is to clarify the precise mechanisms of how vasoactive intestinal peptide is implicated in the pathogenesis of these disorders. We investigated the expression of vasoactive intestinal peptide and its receptors in normal human fibroblasts and keratinocytes, as well as in a human epidermal keratinocyte cell  line DJM-1, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting. Type I VIP receptor mRNA was expressed in normal human keratinocytes and DJM-1 cells, and the latter also expressed type II receptor in lesser amounts. Neither type I nor type II VIP receptor mRNA was detected in fibroblasts, and vasoactive intestinal peptide transcript was not found in any cells examined. Type I VIP receptor mRNA was upregulated by Th1 cytokines (interferon-gamma), Th2 cytokines (interleukin-4), and tumor necrosis factor alpha, as well as vasoactive intestinal peptide itself, suggesting the presence of an autoregulatory loop. Vasoactive intestinal peptide increased cAMP production and cell proliferation of DJM-1 cells, and also induced the production of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and RANTES. The production of cAMP and cytokines was abrogated by a type I VIP receptor selective antagonist, indicating that type I receptor mediates these effects. Overall, these results suggest that upregulation of vasoactive intestinal peptide receptors by cytokines from inflammatory cells in the dermis enhances the proliferation and cytokine production of keratinocytes in response to vasoactive  intestinal peptide from nerve endings. This cytokine network around keratinocytes may be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory dermatoses.  DOI: 10.1046/j.0022-202x.2001.doc.x 	11348464

Author information:  (1)Hannover Medical University, Department of Dermatology and Allergology, Hannover, Germany.  CC chemokine receptors are expressed on hematopoietic cells, and these may impart selective homing of monocyte, leukocyte, and lymphocyte subsets to sites of inflammation. CC chemokine receptor 3 is the major receptor on eosinophils and is also expressed on other inflammatory cells suggesting its important role for allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis and bronchial asthma. Eotaxin, eotaxin-2 and eotaxin-3 have been identified as ligands that only activate CC chemokine receptor 3. CC chemokine receptor 3 is also activated by other promiscuous ligands, however, such as RANTES and monocyte chemotactic protein 4.  To date, CC chemokine receptor 3 has not been reported to be expressed on nonhematopoietic cells. In this study, we investigated whether keratinocytes possess autocrine and paracrine mechanisms for CC chemokine secretion and receptor expression as reported for the expression of interleukin 8 and its receptors. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated  that CC chemokine receptor 3 mRNA is expressed constitutively in cultured keratinocytes. The signal quantities of the CC chemokine receptor 3 amplicons showed lower intensities for keratinocytes than for eosinophils. In situ hybridization techniques exhibited that basal cell layers of the epidermis were stained homogeneously for CC chemokine receptor 3 mRNA with a decreasing signal to the upper epidermis showing that differentiating and proliferating keratinocytes did express mRNA specific for CC chemokine receptor 3. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed low expression of CC chemokine receptor 3 protein on epidermal keratinocytes compared to the high level observed on infiltrating eosinophils. Furthermore, stimulation of cultured keratinocytes with eotaxin resulted in an increased [3H]thymidine incorporation indicating a role of CC chemokine receptor 3 in epidermal proliferation and differentiation. These data demonstrate that CC chemokine receptor 3 is expressed not only on hematopoietic cells but also on keratinocytes as nonhematopoietic cells with ectodermal origin. Therefore, the identification of CC chemokine receptor 3 on epidermal keratinocytes may indicate a role for CC chemokine receptor 3 and its ligands in skin physiology and pathophysiology.

Pine bark extract pycnogenol downregulates IFN-gamma-induced adhesion of T cells  to human keratinocytes by inhibiting inducible ICAM-1 expression.  Bito T(1), Roy S, Sen CK, Packer L.  Author information:  (1)Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley 94720-3200, USA.  Expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is necessary for leukocyte/keratinocyte interactions. Upregulation of ICAM-1 expression in keratinocytes has been observed in several inflammatory dermatoses, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and lupus erythematosus. Inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), upregulate ICAM-1 expression in keratinocytes. Because of potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of  the French maritime pine bark extract, Pycnogenol (Horphag Research, Geneva, Switzerland), its effects were investigated on the interaction of T cells with keratinocytes after activation with IFN-gamma and the molecular mechanisms involved in such interactions. Studies were performed using a human keratinocyte  cell line, HaCaT. Cell adhesion in the presence of IFN-gamma was studied using a  coculture assay. Treatment of HaCaT cells with 20 U/ml IFN-gamma for 24 h markedly induced adherence of Jurkat T cells to HaCaT cells. PYC pretreatment (50 microg/ml, 12 h) significantly inhibited IFN-gamma induced adherence of T cells to HaCaT cells (p < .01). ICAM-1 plays a major role in the IFN-gamma-induced adherence of T cells to keratinocytes. Thus, the effect of PYC on IFN-gamma-induced ICAM-1 expression was investigated as well. Pretreatment of HaCaT cells with PYC significantly inhibited IFN-gamma-induced expression of ICAM-1 expression in HaCaT cells. The downregulation of inducible ICAM-1 expression by PYC was both dose and time dependent. A 50 microg/ml dose of PYC and a 12 h pretreatment time (i.e., before activation with IFN-gamma) provided maximal (approximately 70%) inhibition of inducible ICAM-1 expression in HaCaT cells. Gamma-activated sequence present on the ICAM-1 gene confers IFN-gamma responsiveness in selected cells of epithelial origin (e.g., keratinocytes) that  are known to express ICAM-1 on activation with IFN-gamma. Gel-shift assays revealed that PYC inhibits IFN-gamma-mediated activation of Stat1, thus suggesting a transcriptional regulation of inducible ICAM-1 expression by PYC. These results indicate the therapeutic potential of PYC in patients with inflammatory skin disorders.  	11281289

Thymus and activation-regulated chemokine in atopic dermatitis: Serum thymus and  activation-regulated chemokine level is closely related with disease activity.  Kakinuma T(1), Nakamura K, Wakugawa M, Mitsui H, Tada Y, Saeki H, Torii H, Asahina A, Onai N, Matsushima K, Tamaki K.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, and the Department of Molecular Preventive Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.  BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory skin disease characterized by the predominant infiltration of TH2-type cells in lesional skin. Thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17) is a chemokine that attracts CC chemokine receptor 4-positive (CCR4+) or CCR8+ cells. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the participation of TARC in AD. METHODS: We measured serum TARC levels in 40 patients with AD, 20 healthy control subjects, and 20 patients with psoriasis. We also examined disease activity by using SCORAD score; serum soluble E-selectin, soluble IL-2 receptor, IgE, and GM-CSF levels; and eosinophil numbers in peripheral blood, as well as correlations between TARC levels and these factors. The positivity of CCR4 of CD4+CD45RO+ cells in PBMCs was examined by using FACS analysis. Immunohistochemical staining of TARC and GM-CSF was performed in the lesional skin of patients with AD. RESULTS: The serum TARC levels of patients with AD were significantly higher than those of healthy control subjects and patients with psoriasis. The serum TARC levels significantly correlated with eosinophil number (r = 0.61), SCORAD score (r = 0.60), and serum soluble E-selectin levels (r = 0.58) and weakly correlated  with serum soluble IL-2 receptor levels (r = 0.34) in patients with AD. The TARC  levels of patients with AD decreased after the treatment in accordance with the improvement of clinical symptoms. The CCR4 positivity of CD4+CD45RO+ cells in PBMCs of patients with AD was also higher than that of healthy control subjects.  Immunohistochemical staining revealed that TARC was positive in keratinocytes in  the epidermis and in vascular endothelial cells, T cells, and dendritic cells in  the dermis. CONCLUSION: Serum TARC levels are associated with disease activity of AD, and TARC may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD.  DOI: 10.1067/mai.2001.113237 	11240957

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, 113-8655, Tokyo, Japan. wakugawa-tky@umin.ac.jp  CC chemokines and their ligands, CC chemokine receptors (CCRs), play an important role in the process of inflammation such as trafficking and activating inflammatory cells. CCR3 is known to be a ligand for CC chemokines such as RANTES, eotaxin and monocyte-chemotactic protein-3 (MCP-3). In this study we examined the expression of CCR3 in cultured normal human keratinocytes (KCs). CCR3 protein and mRNA expressions were detected in cultured normal KCs by flow cytometric (FACS) analysis and reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. FACS analysis demonstrated that CCR3 expression on KCs was significantly upregulated when the cells were cultured with RANTES, but not with  eotaxin, IL-4 or interferon-gamma. RT-PCR analysis revealed that CCR3 mRNA was detectable in normal KCs. We also examined the immunoreactivity of CCR3 in normal skin and inflammatory skin lesions. CCR3 was detected weakly in epidermis of normal skin, while strong immunoreactivity for CCR3 was seen in epidermis of inflammatory skin lesions such as atopic dermatitis. These results suggest that CCR3 is constitutively expressed on KCs and is involved in inflammatory modulation. RANTES may regulate the function of KCs through CCR3.  	11240271

Author information:  (1)Laboratory of Immunology, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IRCCS, Rome, Italy.  Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory disease which results from complex interactions between genetic and environmental mechanisms. An altered lipid composition of the stratum corneum is responsible for the xerotic aspect of the skin and determines a higher permeability to allergens and irritants. Keratinocytes of AD patients exhibit a propensity to an exaggerated production of cytokines and chemokines, a phenomenon that can have a major role in promoting and maintaining inflammation. Specific immune responses against a variety of environmental allergens are also implicated in AD pathogenesis, with a bias towards Th2 immune responses. In particular, dendritic cells expressing membrane  IgE receptors play a critical role in the amplification of allergen-specific T cell responses. Cross-linkage of specific IgE receptors on dermal mast cells provokes the release and synthesis of a vast series of mediators. Following their recruitment and activation into the skin, eosinophils are also thought to contribute relevantly to tissue damage. Thus, a complex network of cytokines and  chemokines contributes to establishing a local milieu that favors the permanence  of inflammation in AD skin.  	11197604

Akaiwa M(1), Yu B, Umeshita-Suyama R, Terada N, Suto H, Koga T, Arima K, Matsushita S, Saito H, Ogawa H, Furue M, Hamasaki N, Ohshima K, Izuhara K.  Author information:  (1)Department of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.  Although the functional roles of interleukin (IL-)13 in haematopoietic cells are  well investigated, those in non-haematopoietic cells remain to be addressed. IL-13 exerts its actions by binding to the IL-13 receptor (IL-13R) on target cells, which is composed of IL-13Ralpha1 and the IL-4 receptor alpha chain (IL-4Ralpha). However, there has been no study of localization of IL-13R in each  tissue. To address this question, we generated monoclonal anti-IL-13Ralpha1 antibody, and performed immunohistochemistry using this antibody and anti-IL-4Ralpha antibody. Distribution of these two components was the same in all examined tissues. Staining was positive in keratinocytes, hair follicles, and sebaceous and sweat glands in skin; in ciliated respiratory epithelial cells in nasal tissue; in heart muscle cells; in foveola cells, gastric glands, and the smooth muscle layer in stomach; and in hepatocytes in liver. However, staining was undetectable in brain and bone marrow. Fibroblasts and endothelial cells were stained in some tissues. These results provide clues to elucidate the known pathological roles of IL-13 in atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis, as well as its unknown physiological roles.  Copyright 2001 Academic Press.

Inducible expression of a CC chemokine liver- and activation-regulated chemokine  (LARC)/macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-3 alpha/CCL20 by epidermal keratinocytes and its role in atopic dermatitis.  Nakayama T(1), Fujisawa R, Yamada H, Horikawa T, Kawasaki H, Hieshima K, Izawa D, Fujiie S, Tezuka T, Yoshie O.  Author information:  (1)Department of Bacteriology, Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama  589-8511, Japan.  Liver-and activation-regulated chemokine (LARC)/macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-3alpha/CCL20 is a CC chemokine which is constitutively expressed by follicle-associated epithelial cells in the mucosa, and attracts cells expressing CCR6 such as immature dendritic cells and alpha(4)beta(7)(high) intestine-seeking memory T cells. Here, we examine LARC/CCL20 expression in the skin. LARC/CCL20 mRNA and protein were induced in primary human keratinocytes upon stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1alpha and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. In mice, intradermal injection of IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha rapidly induced a local accumulation of transcripts for LARC/CCL20 and its receptor CCR6  with a lag of several hours in the latter. In humans, immunostaining of LARC/CCL20 was weak if any in normal skin tissues but strongly augmented in lesional skin tissues with atopic dermatitis. Furthermore, massive infiltration of cells with markers such as CD1a, CD3 or HLA-DR was present in atopic skin lesions. Many infiltrating cells were also found to be CCR6(+) by a newly generated monoclonal anti-CCR6. However, Langerhans cells residing within the epidermis were hardly stained by anti-CCR6 in normal and atopic skin tissues. Furthermore, plasma levels of LARC/CCL20 were found to be elevated in patients with atopic dermatitis. Collectively, our results suggest that epidermal keratinocytes produce LARC/CCL20 upon stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines  such as IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha, and attract CCR6-expressing immature dendritic cells and memory/effector T cells into the dermis of inflamed skin such as atopic dermatitis. LARC/CCL20 may not, however, play a major role in homeostatic migration of Langerhans cells into the skin.  	11133838

Vestergaard C(1), Bang K, Gesser B, Yoneyama H, Matsushima K, Larsen CG.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Marselisborg Hospital, University of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark. chr-vest@post9.tele.dk  Atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory skin disease in which the inflammation is characterized by the influx of lymphocytes into the dermis. It is generally believed that atopic dermatitis is a Th2-type disease, i.e., the T lymphocytes produce interleukin-4, interleukin-5, interleukin-10, and interleukin-13, although it has become evident in recent years that the cytokine profile in the skin changes during the course of the disease towards a Th1-Th2 mixed cytokine profile (interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-2). The lymphocytes that home into the skin express cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen, and it has recently been shown that most of the lymphocytes in this population express the chemokine receptor CCR4. CCR4 is the receptor for the CC chemokine TARC (thymus and activation regulated chemokine), and this chemokine is expressed predominantly by keratinocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis of lesional atopic dermatitis skin in mice. In humans, however, it was shown to be expressed in the endothelial cells of the dermis. We have examined the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of atopic dermatitis patients for the expression of cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen and CCR4 and compared them with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal controls. We found that the proportion of CLA+CCR4+ lymphocytes is upregulated in atopic dermatitis patients. In addition we have examined skin biopsies of lesional and non-lesional skin from atopic dermatitis patients and found that the keratinocytes, but not the endothelial cells, produce TARC in the lesional but not in the nonlesional skin.  To gain insight in the stimulatory mechanisms for TARC production in keratinocytes, as previously observed in mice, we cultured HaCaT cells and found  that interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha work synergistically to induce TARC production. These observations suggest that the induction of TARC production in keratinocytes plays an important role in the late phase skin invasion by CCR4+CLA+ Th2-type lymphocytes in atopic dermatitis.

Trautmann A(1), Akdis M, Kleemann D, Altznauer F, Simon HU, Graeve T, Noll M, Bröcker EB, Blaser K, Akdis CA.  Author information:  (1)Swiss Institute of Allergy and Asthma Research (SIAF), Davos, Switzerland. atraut@siaf.unizh.ch  Comment in     J Clin Invest. 2000 Jul;106(1):9-10.  Clinical and histologic similarities between various eczematous disorders point to a common efferent pathway. We demonstrate here that activated T cells infiltrating the skin in atopic dermatitis (AD) and allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) induce keratinocyte (KC) apoptosis. KCs normally express low levels of Fas  receptor (FasR) that can be substantially enhanced by the presence of IFN-gamma.  KCs are rendered susceptible to apoptosis by IFN-gamma when FasR numbers reach a  threshold of approximately 40,000 per KC. Subsequently, KCs undergo apoptosis induced by anti-FasR mAb's, soluble Fas ligand, supernatants from activated T cells, or direct contact between T cells and KCs. Apoptotic KCs show typical DNA  fragmentation and membrane phosphatidylserine expression. KC apoptosis was demonstrated in situ in lesional skin affected by AD, ACD, and patch tests. Using numerous cytokines and anti-cytokine neutralizing mAb's, we found no evidence that cytokines other than IFN-gamma participate in this process. In addition, apoptosis-inducing pathways other than FasR triggering were ruled out by blocking T cell-induced KC apoptosis by caspase inhibitors and soluble Fas-Fc protein. Responses of normal human skin and cultured skin equivalents to activated T cells demonstrated that KC apoptosis caused by skin-infiltrating T cells is a key event in the pathogenesis of eczematous dermatitis.

Tada Y(1), Asahina A, Nakamura K, Tomura M, Fujiwara H, Tamaki K.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. ytada-tky@umin.ac.jp  We investigated the capacity of mouse Langerhans cells (LC) to produce IL-12, a central cytokine in a Th1 type of immune responses. We prepared purified LC (>95%) from BALB/c mouse skin by the panning method using anti-I-Ad mAb. An ELISA showed that purified LC spontaneously produced IL-12 p40, and that its production was up-regulated following simultaneous stimulation with anti-CD40 mAb and IFN-gamma. Surprisingly, GM-CSF strikingly inhibited IL-12 p40 production by anti-CD40/IFN-gamma-stimulated LC (% inhibition = 97.0 +/- 0.9% at 1 ng/ml GM-CSF). Supernatants of 48-h cultured keratinocytes (KC) also caused the inhibition of LC IL-12 p40 secretion, and this effect was neutralized by anti-GM-CSF mAb. IL-1alpha (1 ng/ml)-stimulated KC produced much more GM-CSF than unstimulated KC (60.9 +/- 0.2 pg/ml vs 20.9 +/- 1.7 pg/ml), and IL-1alpha-stimulated KC supernatants strongly inhibited IL-12 p40 production by anti-CD40/IFN-gamma-stimulated LC (% inhibition = 89.4 +/- 1.4%). A bioassay using an IL-12-dependent T cell line demonstrated the correlation of the level of IL-12 p40 with the bioactivity of IL-12. These results provide important implications for the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, which involves the participation of LC and KC with the capacity to produce IL-12 and GM-CSF, respectively.  	10799868

Ting KM(1), Rothaupt D, McCormick TS, Hammerberg C, Chen G, Gilliam AC, Stevens S, Culp L, Cooper KD.  Author information:  (1)Departments of Dermatology and Microbiology and Molecular Biology, Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio 44106-5028, USA.  The extracellular matrix protein, Fn, has critical functions in cell attachment,  migration, differentiation, and proliferation. We have previously shown that fibronectin (Fn) is abnormally expressed and potentiates entry into the cell cycle of basal keratinocytes in uninvolved psoriatic skin, in combination with T  cell lymphokines. It is not known what type of Fn is present in psoriatic skin, however, and how this Fn may regulate signaling. Embryonic forms of cellular Fn containing extra domains, designated EDA and EDB, are generated by alternative splicing and are seen in proliferating, developing tissue and in wound healing. Because the EDA segment enhances the integrin binding sequence Arg, Gly, Asp (RGD), which, when present, has been shown to be critical in integrin-extracellular matrix signaling, we were particularly interested in determining whether or not EDA-containing Fn (EDA+Fn) represented the aberrantly  expressed Fn in psoriasis. Increased EDA+ Fn protein was demonstrated by immunostaining at the dermal-epidermal junction in clinically uninvolved skin from six of six patients with psoriasis, but not in skin from control subjects. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction an increased ratio of EDA+  Fn versus EDA- Fn mRNA was present in epidermal samples from psoriatic but not control individuals. Interestingly, the EDA+Fn in the psoriatic epidermis had the IIICS region spliced out (EDA+, FDB-, IIICS-, III9+), which was shared with normal epidermis (EDA-, EDB-, IIICS-, III9+). These results suggest a selective predominance of the EDA+ Fn isoform at the dermal-epidermal junction of psoriatic skin. The consistent aberrant localization of EDA+ Fn at the dermal-epidermal junction in uninvolved skin of psoriatics may confer the hyperresponsiveness of psoriatic uninvolved basal keratinocytes for rapid cellular proliferation in response to T cell signals.

Homey B(1), Wang W, Soto H, Buchanan ME, Wiesenborn A, Catron D, Müller A, McClanahan TK, Dieu-Nosjean MC, Orozco R, Ruzicka T, Lehmann P, Oldham E, Zlotnik A.  Author information:  (1)DNAX Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.  We recently reported the identification of a chemokine (CTACK), which has been renamed CCL27 according to a new systematic chemokine nomenclature. We report that CCL27 binds the previously orphan chemokine receptor GPR-2, as detected by calcium flux and chemotactic responses of GPR-2 transfectants. We renamed this receptor CCR10. Because of the skin-associated expression pattern of CCL27, we focused on the expression of CCL27 and CCR10 in normal skin compared with inflammatory and autoimmune skin diseases. CCL27 is constitutively produced by keratinocytes but can also be induced upon stimulation with TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. CCR10 is not expressed by keratinocytes and is instead expressed by melanocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and dermal microvascular endothelial cells. CCR10 was also detected in T cells as well as in skin-derived Langerhans cells. Taken together, these observations suggest a role for this novel ligand/receptor  pair in both skin homeostasis as well as a potential role in inflammatory responses.  	10725697
313. Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2000 Jan;84(1):3-10; quiz 11-2.	 Role of staphylococcal superantigens in atopic dermatitis: from colonization to inflammation.  Taskapan MO(1), Kumar P.  Author information:  (1)LSU Health Sciences Center, Dept. of Allergy & Clin. Immunology, Louisiana State University, School of Medicine, New Orleans 70112-2822, USA.  OBJECTIVE: This review article has been prepared in order to enable the readers to understand the role of staphylococcal superantigens (SsAgs) in atopic dermatitis (AD). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE literature search was performed for obtaining references. Recent reviews, research articles, poster presentations, and letters (to the editor) were meticulously reviewed. RESULTS: (1) SsAgs contribute to the pathogenesis of cutaneous inflammation in AD with five potential mechanisms: Direct stimulation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and keratinocytes. Stimulation of T cell proliferation [superantigenic binding to T cell receptor (TCR)]. Expansion of skin-homing cutaneous lymphocyte  antigen (CLA) (+) T cells. The role of superantigens as allergens. Reduction of apoptosis. (2) Effectiveness of antibiotic therapy in AD patients without signs of bacterial infection is still under discussion. If signs of skin infection are  present, antibiotic therapy (topical/oral) may help exacerbations of AD. Prolonged topical/oral antibiotic therapy, however, may cause development of antibiotic-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (SA). CONCLUSIONS: Atopic dermatitis is a genetically determined, chronically relapsing, inflammatory skin disease which has many aspects and a complex immunopathogenesis involving both immediate and cellular immune responses. While  the pathogenic role of SsAgs may not be of primary importance, SsAgs appear to be one of the important triggering factors that contribute to the cutaneous inflammation in AD. We suggest that staphylococcal colonization does not always mean SsAg-mediated inflammation, and anti-staphylococcal treatment should be considered in cases with signs of bacterial infection.

Modulation by immunosuppressive drugs and cytokines in normal cultured keratinocytes.  Müschen A(1), Mirmohammadsadegh A, Jarzebska-Deussen B, Abts HF, Ruzicka T, Michel G.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf, Germany.  OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: The effects of the anticytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) are  mediated by specific receptors. In this study we examined the role of the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) in the pathophysiology of atopic eczema. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this purpose we analyzed the expression of IL-10R in the skin of patients with acute and chronic atopic eczema in comparison to the expression in healthy individuals using in situ binding experiments with fluorescently labeled IL-10 and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR specific for IL-10R1. In addition, we studied the influence of the Th2-associated cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4), the Th1-associated gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma), the immunosuppressive drug FK506, the H1-antagonist loratadine and UVA irradiation on the expression of IL-10R1 in cultured normal human keratinocytes. RESULTS: We found that IL-10 receptor mRNA and protein are strongly downregulated in acute phase atopic lesions. Furthermore we could show that IL-4, IFN-gamma, FK506, loratadine and UVA enhance the mRNA levels of the IL-10R1 in vitro in normal cultured keratinocytes. We could also demonstrate restored IL-10R1 mRNA levels in lesional atopic skin of a patient after UVA1 therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate for the first time that IL-10 receptors may  have a role in the pathogenesis of atopic eczema and its upregulation by FK506 and UVA could explain the therapeutic efficacy of these agents.

Travers JB(1), Hamid QA, Norris DA, Kuhn C, Giorno RC, Schlievert PM, Farmer ER,  Leung DY.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Indiana University Medical Center, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA.  Comment in     J Clin Invest. 1999 Nov;104(9):1161-4.  Streptococcal and staphylococcal superantigens (SAg's) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases, but the mechanisms by which these toxins act are unknown. The present study assessed the ability of nanogram quantities of topically applied purified toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), staphylococcal enterotoxin type B, and streptococcal pyrogenic enterotoxin types  A and C to induce inflammatory reactions in clinically uninvolved skin of normal  controls and subjects with psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and lichen planus. These SAg's triggered a significantly greater inflammatory skin response in psoriatics  than in normal control subjects or in subjects with atopic dermatitis or lichen planus. Surprisingly, skin biopsies did not exhibit the T-cell receptor Vbeta stimulatory properties predicted for SAg-induced skin reactions. By 6 hours after patch testing with SAg's, TNF-alpha mRNA had increased in the epidermis (but not  the dermis) in biopsies from psoriatics, compared with controls. Immunohistochemical studies revealed significantly higher HLA-DR expression in keratinocytes from psoriatics than from controls. However, a mutant TSST-1 protein that fails to bind HLA-DR did not elicit an inflammatory skin reaction. These results indicate that keratinocyte expression of HLA-DR enhances inflammatory skin responses to SAg's. They may also account for previous studies  failing to demonstrate selective expansion of T-cell receptor Vbetas in psoriatics colonized with SAg-producing Staphylococcus aureus, and they identify  a novel T cell-independent mechanism by which SAg's contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases.

Author information:  (1)Department of Molecular Preventive Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.  We have examined the expression of chemokines and their receptors in the atopic dermatitis-like (AD-like) lesions of NC/Nga mice. Such lesions develop when the mice are kept in conventional conditions, but not when they are kept isolated from specific pathogens. The thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine TARC is unexpectedly highly expressed in the basal epidermis of 14-week-old mice with lesions, whereas it is not expressed in the skin without lesions. Production of TARC by keratinocytes was confirmed by culturing murine keratinocytic cell line cells (PAM212) with TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, or IL-1beta. Expression of another Th2  chemokine, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), was observed in the skin from mice kept in both conventional and pathogen-free conditions, but expression of MDC was increased severalfold in the skin with lesions. The cellular origin of MDC was identified to be dermal dendritic cells. Infiltration of the skin by IL-4-producing T cells and mast cells, and the increase of CCR4 mRNA in the skin, coincided with the development of AD lesions. These observations indicate that TARC and MDC actively participate in the pathogenesis of AD-like lesions in NC/Nga mice and that these Th2 chemokines could be novel targets for intervention therapy of AD in humans.

Morishita Y(1), Tada J, Sato A, Toi Y, Kanzaki H, Akiyama H, Arata J.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Okayama University Medical School, Okayama, Japan.  BACKGROUND: Heavy colonization of atopic dermatitis (AD) with Staphylococcus aureus is well documented. This phenomenon suggests that S. aureus in AD lesions  influences the disease processes of AD. OBJECTIVE: We describe the importance of the presence of S. aureus and staphylococcal enterotoxins A and B (SEA, SEB) in AD lesions. METHODS: We investigated the colonizing features of S. aureus in AD lesions using electron microscopy, the distribution of SEB in the eczematous skin of AD using immunofluorescence, the effects of SEA and SEB on normal human epidermal keratinocytes in organ culture, and the presence of specific IgE antibodies to SEA and/or SEB in serum of AD patients by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: S. aureus in AD lesions colonized on and in the horny layers of the eczematous skin. SEB produced by S. aureus was distributed mainly on the dermal-infiltrated cells, especially on eosinophils. SEA and SEB stimulated expression of ICAM-1 and HLA-DR in normal human keratinocytes. More than half of  the AD patients in the present study had specific IgE antibodies to SEA and/or SEB in their serum. CONCLUSION: S. aureus and SEs have important roles in the exacerbation and prolongation of AD.  	10457116

Steinhoff M(1), Corvera CU, Thoma MS, Kong W, McAlpine BE, Caughey GH, Ansel JC,  Bunnett NW.  Author information:  (1)Department of Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, USA.  Proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) is a G-protein coupled receptor. Tryptic  proteases cleave PAR-2 exposing a tethered ligand (SLIGKV), which binds and activates the receptor. Although PAR-2 is highly expressed by cultured keratinocytes and is an inflammatory mediator, its precise localization in the normal and inflamed human skin is unknown, and the proteases that activate PAR-2  in the skin have not been identified. We localized PAR-2 in human skin by immunohistochemistry, examined PAR-2 expression by RT-PCR and RNA blotting, and investigated PAR-2 activation by mast cell tryptase. PAR-2 was localized to keratinocytes, especially in the granular layer, to endothelial cells, hair follicles, myoepithelial cells of sweat glands, and dermal dendritic-like cells.  PAR-2 was also highly expressed in keratinocytes and endothelial cells of inflamed skin. PAR-2 mRNA was detected in normal human skin by RT-PCR, and in cultured human keratinocytes and dermal microvascular endothelial cells by Northern hybridization. Trypsin, tryptase and a peptide corresponding to the tethered ligand (SLIGKVNH2) increased [Ca2+]i in keratinocytes, measured using Fura-2/AM. Although tryptase-containing mast cells were sparsely scattered in the normal dermis, they were numerous in the dermis in atopic dermatitis, and in the  dermis, dermal-epidermal border, and occasionally within the lower epidermis in psoriasis. Tryptase may activate PAR-2 on keratinocytes and endothelial cells during inflammation.  	10439226

Mizutani H(1), Ohmoto Y, Kupper TS, Shimizu M.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Mie University School of Medicine, Japan. h-mizuta@clin.medic.mie-u.ac.jp  Interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha) is thought to play a central role in inflammatory  reactions of the skin. Its excessive production and discharge by keratinocytes has been implicated in psoriasis, bullous diseases and other skin diseases. In addition to the type 2 IL-1 receptor and the IL-1 receptor antagonist, anti-IL-1  antibody in human serum has been proposed as a potential means to down regulate systemic responses attributable to IL-1. However, the relationship of these antibodies to disease and particularly to disease pathogenesis is still unclear.  To understand this relationship, we characterized the anti-IL-1 autoantibody in sera from various skin diseases. IL-1alpha and IL-1beta radioimmunoassay, and immuno-blotting study showed the existence of IL-1alpha autoantibody but not autoantibodies to IL-1beta or pro-IL-1beta. High titer of anti-IL-1alpha autoantibodies were detected in the sera from inflammatory skin diseases with epidermal injury, including psoriasis, palmoplantar pustulosis, pustular psoriasis, pemphigus and lichen planus. In contrast, few samples from non-epidermodestructive bullous pemphigoid, atopic dermatitis and healthy normal  controls had autoantibodies. The titer of anti-IL-1alpha autoantibodies showed some relation to the clinical course of psoriasis and pemphigus. Anti-IL-1 autoantibody neutralized rhIL-1alpha in D10.G4 assay and inhibited receptor binding of FITC-rhIL-1alpha. Taken together present data, the keratinocyte derived IL-1alpha could be a source of autoantigen that provokes production of endogenous anti-IL-1alpha autoantibody, which may regulate IL-1alpha mediated cutaneous inflammation.  	10342749
321. J Invest Dermatol. 1999 Jan;112(1):91-6.	 Sphingosylphosphorylcholine is a potent inducer of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression in human keratinocytes.  Imokawa G(1), Takagi Y, Higuchi K, Kondo H, Yada Y.  Author information:  (1)Biological Science Laboratories, Kao Corporation, Haga, Tochigi, Japan.  We recently reported that the epidermis of patients with atopic dermatitis contains an abnormally expressed sphingomyelin deacylase that yields a large amount of sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) rather than ceramide. In this study,  we characterize inflammatory roles of newly discovered chemicals in the epidermis by elucidating biologic effects of SPC on intercellular adhesion molecules-1 (ICAM-I) expression by human keratinocytes in culture in comparison with other sphingolipids. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, we found that SPC treatment at concentrations of 10-20 microM significantly enhanced the expression of ICAM-I by cultured human keratinocytes in a dose-dependent manner after incubation for 15-24 h, and, using northern blot analysis, that this was accompanied by increased expression of ICAM-1 mRNA within 4 h of incubation. Transforming necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels in the medium of keratinocytes treated at a 10 microM concentration of SPC were significantly increased by 200%. Furthermore, the SPC-induced ICAM-1 expression was partially abolished by the concomitant addition of anti-TNF-alpha, suggesting a partial autocrine involvement of TNF-alpha in ICAM-1 expression. Assay of mitogen-activated protein kinase revealed that 10 microM SPC induced a rapid activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase in human keratinocytes, including  an increase in its phosphorylation within 5 min, which then declined to the baseline control level after 30 min. In contrast, sphingomyelin or sphingosine had no significant potential to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase at the  same concentration. These findings suggest that SPC plays an important role in the inflammatory process of epidermis in skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, with high expression of sphingomyelin deacylase.

Mast cells of psoriatic and atopic dermatitis skin are positive for TNF-alpha and their degranulation is associated with expression of ICAM-1 in the epidermis.  Ackermann L(1), Harvima IT.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Kuopio, Finland.  The release of cytokines from cutaneous cells may be of major importance in the initiation and development of many inflammatory skin disorders. For example, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which in healthy skin is found preformed only in mast cells, is able to induce the expression of several adhesion molecules including intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Increased expression of ICAM-1 occurs in keratinocytes in lesional skin of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD) and it is considered to be an important initiator of leucocyte/keratinocyte interactions in skin inflammation. We counted the mast cells showing TNF-alpha immunoreactivity using a double-staining method in nonlesional and lesional skin sections from 12 patients with AD and 12 patients with psoriasis. The percentage of TNF-alpha+ mast cells in lesional and nonlesional AD skin was 36 +/- 22% and 21 +/- 15% (P < 0.018, paired t-test), respectively, and in psoriatic skin was 16 +/- 25% and 15 +/- 15%, respectively (P < 0.89, paired t-test). We also cultured whole skin biopsies taken from the healthy-looking skin of psoriatic and AD patients in the presence of mast cell degranulator compound 48/80, which resulted in focal expression of ICAM-1 in the  epidermis. In cultured keratinocytes, both histamine and an extract of a human mast-cell line (HMC-1) induced ICAM-1 immunostaining only in occasional cells, but the combination of histamine and the HMC-1 extract resulted in intense ICAM-1 staining in numerous cells. This enhancement of ICAM-1 staining was abolished by  preincubation of the HMC-1 extract with anti-TNF-alpha antibody. These results suggest that the degranulation of mast cells induces the expression of ICAM-1 in  keratinocytes probably via TNF-alpha and histamine.  	9749989

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Japan.  The role of Fas-mediated apoptosis in cutaneous lupus erythematosus (LE) is still unclear, although the Fas/FasL system has been investigated in autoimmune diseases in relation to impaired apoptosis. In order to elucidate the connections between acute cutaneous LE (ACLE) and chronic cutaneous LE (CCLE), we determined  the expression of membranous Fas antigen (mFas) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by flow cytometry and the levels of the soluble form of the Fas antigen (sFas) in sera. The ratio and the mean fluorescence intensity of mFas were much higher in ACLE patients than in others, including patients with CCLE and atopic dermatitis and normal healthy controls. The levels of sFas in ACLE and CCLE patients were also elevated, and there was a significant increase in sFas levels in ACLE patients over that in CCLE patients. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that Fas antigen was predominantly expressed on infiltrating cells around blood vessels and appendages in ACLE and CCLE patients. Based on these findings, it is suggested that the expression of Fas antigen is closely associated with the activation of circulating lymphocytes, especially in ACLE patients, but is not directly associated with keratinocyte damage.  	9640883

Pastore S(1), Corinti S, La Placa M, Didona B, Girolomoni G.  Author information:  (1)Laboratory of Immunology, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IRCCS, Rome, Italy.  Recent studies suggest that skin keratinocytes from patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and nonatopic subjects differ in their intrinsic ability to respond to proinflammatory stimuli. In this study keratinocyte cultures established from the normal-looking skin of six adult patients with AD and six healthy, nonatopic control subjects were compared in their response to interferon (IFN)-gamma, a potent proinflammatory lymphokine whose expression is increased in chronic AD lesions. Basal expression of IFN-gamma receptor as well as IFN-gamma-induced membrane expression of HLA-DR and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 were evaluated by flow cytometry. Keratinocyte release of IL-1alpha, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were measured  by ELISA on culture supernatants after treatment with IFN-gamma or medium alone.  Expression of membrane IFN-gamma receptor was similar in keratinocytes cultured from nonatopic subjects and subjects with AD. IFN-gamma (10 to 500 U/ml) induced  comparable levels of membrane HLA-DR and ICAM-1 in both groups of keratinocytes.  In contrast, spontaneous release of IL-1alpha, IL-1ra, GM-CSF, and TNF-alpha was  increased in the supernatants of unstimulated keratinocytes from patients with AD compared with keratinocytes from control subjects, with IL-1ra and GM-CSF reaching statistically significant difference. Moreover, IFN-gamma-induced release of all the cytokines tested was much higher for keratinocytes from patients with AD, but the IL-1ra/IL-1alpha ratio for the two groups of keratinocytes was not substantially different, either basally or after IFN-gamma  stimulation. The results indicate that keratinocytes from patients with AD are hyperresponsive to IFN-gamma in terms of cytokine release.  DOI: 10.1016/S0091-6749(98)70361-6 	9564808

Demonstration and functional analysis of IL-10 receptors in human epidermal cells: decreased expression in psoriatic skin, down-modulation by IL-8, and up-regulation by an antipsoriatic glucocorticosteroid in normal cultured keratinocytes.  Michel G(1), Mirmohammadsadegh A, Olasz E, Jarzebska-Deussen B, Müschen A, Kemény L, Abts HF, Ruzicka T.  Author information:  (1)Center for Biological and Medical Research, Department of Dermatology, University of Düsseldorf, Germany. michelg@rz.uni-duesseldorf.de  The chronic skin disease psoriasis is characterized by epidermal hyperproliferation and inflammation. The exact etiology of the disease is still unknown. At the molecular level, overexpression of growth factors and proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-8 and the corresponding receptor has been described in psoriatic plaques. On the other hand, the loss of inhibitory control mechanisms is involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, as exemplified by the  reduced mRNA levels for the cell cycle inhibitor p53 found in lesional skin. Here we extend these findings to a cytokine with negative regulatory functions, IL-10. Only under certain conditions are human keratinocytes able to synthesize IL-10. In skin, pathological overexpression of IL-10 was described om atopic dermatitis. IL-10 exerts its effects via a specific receptor (IL-10R). We show here for the first time the presence and functionality of IL-10R in epidermal cells and its dramatically decreased expression in acute exanthematic psoriatic epidermis by in vitro and in situ binding studies. These results were substantiated using semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR, demonstrating decreased expression of the IL-10R gene in psoriatic skin, its down-modulation by the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8, and its pharmacological induction in cultured cells. Biological responsiveness of epidermal cells toward IL-10 could also be demonstrated by a reduction of the growth rate and inhibition of IFN-gamma-induced HLA-DR expression. Our results provide the first evidence for a role of the IL-10R gene  in the homeostasis of the epidermis and substantiate the concept of a loss of negative regulatory peptides as a step in the eruption of psoriasis.  	9550434

Staniek V(1), Liebich C, Vocks E, Odia SG, Doutremepuich JD, Ring J, Claudy A, Schmitt D, Misery L.  Author information:  (1)INSERM U 346, Pavillon. R, E. Herriot Hospital, Lyon, France.  Atopic dermatitis is a pruritic inflammatory skin disorder, involving immunological and non-immunological factors. Substance P seems to be involved in  the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis. Substance P-containing nerve fibers are increased in the lesional skin of patients with atopic dermatitis and a reduced weal and flare reaction to intradermal injection of substance P has been observed. We investigated the distribution of substance P receptors in the involved skin of patients before and after single or repetitive UVA irradiations. Our results indicate that substance P receptors of the NK-1 subtype are expressed on blood vessels and on epidermal keratinocytes of involved skin of patients with atopic dermatitis. UVA irradiations did not modify the epidermal distribution of  substance P receptors but decreased their expression intensity on blood vessels.  UVA irradiations seem to decrease skin inflammation through the modulation of NK-1 receptor expression on endothelial cells.  	9534883
327. J Invest Dermatol. 1998 Jan;110(1):8-12.	 Abnormal transglutaminase 1 expression pattern in a subset of patients with erythrodermic autosomal recessive ichthyosis.  Choate KA(1), Williams ML, Khavari PA.  Author information:  (1)VA Palo Alto Health Care System, California 94304, USA.  An autosomal recessive ichthyosis characterized by collodian membrane at birth followed by generalized skin redness and fine, light-colored scales has been termed nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (CIE). CIE has often been classified together with the other major form of recessive ichthyosis without internal organ involvement, lamellar ichthyosis, which is characterized by minimal erythema and a coarser, darker scale pattern. Recently, autosomal recessive ichthyosis has been associated with keratinocyte transglutaminase (TGase1) defects in some patients. This group of diseases, however, is genetically heterogeneous and TGase1 abnormalities in CIE have not been clearly described. Therefore we examined TGase1 expression in five patients with CIE and  three with classic lamellar ichthyosis. Although lamellar ichthyosis patients displayed no TGase1 expression, an abnormal intracellular accumulation of TGase1  was observed in four of five CIE patients. This finding was specific and was not  observed in other skin disorders characterized by erythema and abnormal cornification, including erythrodermic psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, and Netherton's syndrome. CIE keratinocytes with abnormal TGase1 localization expressed full-length TGase1 mRNA and protein but demonstrated transglutaminase activity intermediate between normal and the minimal activity seen in lamellar ichthyosis patient cells. The abnormal TGase1 expression pattern and CIE clinical features were recapitulated in epidermis regenerated in vivo on immune deficient mice from CIE patient keratinocytes. These studies describe a specific abnormality in TGase1 intrinsic to keratinocytes in a subset of CIE patients and suggest that this abnormality may be involved in the disordered epidermal differentiation seen in this disorder.

328. Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 1997 Aug;113(4):495-504.	 Adhesion molecules in atopic dermatitis: upregulation of alpha6 integrin expression in spontaneous lesional skin as well as in atopen, antigen and irritative induced patch test reactions.  Jung K(1), Imhof BA, Linse R, Wollina U, Neumann C.  Author information:  (1)Clinic of Dermatology Erfurt, Germany.  Atopic dermatitis is a lymphocyte-mediated skin disease. We studied the expression of the adhesion molecule alpha6 integrin by immunohistochemistry in spontaneous atopic inflammation as well as during the eliciting phase of atopen (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus), antigen (nickel sulfate) and irritative (anthralin) induced patch test reactions in atopic skin. Results were compared with nickel sulfate patch test reactions in normal skin. A role of the alpha6 integrin, expressed at the luminal side of blood vessels, for T cell migration in lesional atopic skin was supposed. In normal human skin the alpha6 integrin was weakly expressed by blood vessels and by basal epithelial cells of the epidermis. In acute and chronic lesional skin of patients with atopic dermatitis dramatic upregulation of alpha6 integrin expression was observed on endothelial cells and  in the epidermis. The similar pattern of upregulated suprabasal alpha6 integrin expression was established in the patch test reactions 48 h after atopen and antigen application or irritation of the skin without differences in dependence on the eliciting substance. No difference of alpha6 integrin expression was seen  between atopic and normal skin. Tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1, interleukin-4 and interferon gamma play a role in atopic inflammation. Tumor growth factor beta and interleukin-6 are mitogenic/growth factors for keratinocytes. For this reason the effect of these cytokines and of phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate on the expression level of alpha6 integrin was tested in short-term skin organ culture of normal and atopic skin as well as in keratinocyte cultures. In these assays no cytokines had an effect on alpha6 integrin expression suggesting another mechanism which regulates this integrin. However, the increased expression of alpha6 integrin in the suprabasal epidermis  is associated with a T cell influx into the epidermis. We speculate that the alpha6 integrin expression may lead to an epidermotropism of T cells during inflammation.  	9250597

Ohki O(1), Yokozeki H, Katayama I, Umeda T, Azuma M, Okumura K, Nishioka K.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University School of Medicine, Japan.  Comment in     Br J Dermatol. 1998 Feb;138(2):358-9.  Recently, we reported the functional expression of CD86 on cultured human Langerhans cells derived from normal epidermis. In the present study, we investigated the expression and function of co-stimulatory molecules in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis. In immunohistochemical analysis, CD80 and/or CD86 were detected on dendritic-shaped cells not only in the epidermis but also in the dermis in the inflammatory lesions of atopic dermatitis (n = 12). CD80 was expressed in only five cases (42%), while CD86 was expressed in all cases (100%). These molecules were not detected in normal control subjects (n = 8). In non-lesional skin of atopic dermatitis (n = 4), CD86 but not CD80 was detected in one case. CD86 was preferentially induced on dendritic-shaped cells in positive patch test sites to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus or house dust allergen in atopic dermatitis (n = 4). The CD80- or CD86-positive cells were confirmed as Langerhans cells by double immunostaining using anti-CD1a monoclonal antibody. Neither CD86 nor CD80 was detected on keratinocytes. Similar results of the stronger expression of CD86 over that of CD80 were obtained from psoriasis vulgaris (n = 11) and from contact dermatitis (n = 7), although CD86 was expressed only in 57% of the contact dermatitis cases. The percentage of Langerhans cells positive for CD86 was higher than for CD80, i.e. 48% compared with 9%, respectively, in the epidermis of lesional skin of atopic dermatitis (n  = 8). The expression rate of these molecules on Langerhans cells increased in the dermis. To investigate the function of co-stimulatory molecules on Langerhans cells in atopic dermatitis, we conducted an inhibition test with antibodies. Anti-CD86 monoclonal antibody almost completely inhibited T-cell proliferation stimulated with crude extract of D. pteronyssinus in the presence of epidermal cells as antigen-presenting cells, whereas anti-CD80 monoclonal antibody produced less of an inhibitory effect. These data indicate that CD86 expressed on Langerhans cells may play an important part in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis.  	9217814

331. Exp Dermatol. 1996 Dec;5(6):316-24.	 Human keratinocytes constitutively express IL-4 receptor molecules and respond to IL-4 with an increase in B7/BB1 expression.  Junghans V(1), Jung T, Neumann C.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Göttingen, Germany.  In certain pathological conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, interleukin-4 (IL-4) can be detected in the skin. As the role of this cytokine in inflammatory  skin lesions is not completely clear, we investigated its biological effects on skin keratinocytes. It was found that freshly isolated as well as cultured keratinocytes obtained from normal individuals express mRNA for the IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) and produce IL-4R protein, as determined by flow cytometry. Moreover, IL-4 induced a proliferative response in keratinocytes after 1 day of culture and enhanced B7/BB1 expression in these cells. B7-2 (CD86) mRNA and protein were neither detected on untreated nor IL-4 treated keratinocytes. In contrast to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), IL-4 did not induce ICAM-1 (CD54) or HLA-DR-expression. Keratinocytes which had been treated with IL-4 showed an enhanced ability to stimulate allogeneic T-cell proliferation in the presence of  staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB), (p < 0.01). Neutralizing anti-B7/BB1 monoclonal antibodies did not block this effect. These results indicate that other molecules than B7/BB-1. HLA-DR or ICAM-1 on IL-4-activated keratinocytes may be involved in T-cell stimulation. In conclusion our results suggest that locally produced IL-4, besides modulating keratinocyte membrane molecules, may enable keratinocytes to interact with skin infiltrating lymphocytes.  	9028793
332. J Invest Dermatol. 1996 Oct;107(4):603-9.	 Staphylococcal toxins and protein A differentially induce cytotoxicity and release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha from human keratinocytes.  Ezepchuk YV(1), Leung DY, Middleton MH, Bina P, Reiser R, Norris DA.  Author information:  (1)Department of Pediatrics, National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, Denver, Colorado, USA.  It has been proposed that toxins and other bacterial protein products of Staphylococcus aureus can act as triggers or persistence factors in several inflammatory skin diseases. In this study, we examined the S. aureus isolates from the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. We found that the bacterial isolates from these patients exhibited either characteristic superantigenic toxins or thermolabile toxins believed to be staphylococcal alpha-toxin. All of these staphylococcal strains also secreted extracellular staphylococcal protein A. We found significant differences in the action of these toxins on human keratinocytes and keratinocyte cell lines. The superantigenic toxins toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, staphylococcal enterotoxins A and B, and exfoliative toxin-A, as well as staphylococcal protein A, did not induce significant cytotoxic damage in the keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, whereas the staphylococcal alpha-toxin produced profound cytotoxicity. Keratinocyte cytotoxicity induced by staphylococcal alpha-toxin was time and concentration dependent and demonstrated the morphologic and functional characteristics of necrosis, not apoptosis. Addition of alpha-toxin to keratinocytes simultaneously  induced cell lysis and tumor necrosis factor-alpha release into the medium within 30 min; apparently, it was constitutive tumor necrosis factor-alpha. On the other hand, superantigenic toxins and, in particular, protein A showed stimulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion in keratinocytes and release of this cytokine after 6-12 h of incubation. Thus, staphylococcal protein A, alpha-toxin, and superantigenic toxins found in S. aureus isolates from patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis can produce direct pro-inflammatory effects on keratinocytes through the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. We propose that these effects may be relevant to the induction and persistence of lesions in these two diseases.  	8823368
333. J Dermatol Sci. 1996 Sep;12(3):219-26.	 ICAM-1 expression on keratinocytes in mechanically-injured skin of a patient with atopic dermatitis.  Matsunaga T(1), Katayama I, Yokozeki H, Nishioka K.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.  The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on keratinocytes was studied in skin specimens of patch- or scratch-test using Dermatophagoides farinae (DF) antigen in atopic dermatitis (AD). Positive patch test reaction showed exocytosis of lymphocytes and focal expression of ICAM-1 on keratinocytes. Similar lymphocyte infiltration and keratinocyte expression of ICAM-1 were observed in tape-stripped skin which was subjected as the control. In addition, focal ICAM-1 expression on keratinocytes was also observed without exocytosis of  lymphocytes. By scratch-test with DF antigen, ICAM-1 expression on keratinocytes  was observed in eight out of eleven patients. One specimen showed ICAM-1 expression in spite of the absence of exocytosis of lymphocytes. Two out of three specimens from negative scratch-test sites with control liquid (mixture of equal  amount of saline and glycerine) showed ICAM-1 expression in a similar manner to that of the positive scratch tests. In normal control skin, patch-test sites showed focal and weak expression of ICAM-1. Normal appearing skin of AD also showed no ICAM-1 expression. Therefore, in patients with atopic dermatitis, keratinocytes may express ICAM-1 prior to infiltration of lymphocytes into the epidermis and this expression might be induced not only by cytokines produced by  lymphocytes but also by mechanically injured (tape-stripped or scratched) epidermal cells.  	8884526

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University School of Medicine, Japan.  Bacterial superantigen such as staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) induced strong  ICAM-1 expression in organ-cultured human keratinocytes. Other superantigens (SEA, SEC1, SEC2) but not mite antigen (Dermatophagoides) also induced ICAM-1 expression both at protein and mRNA level. In contrast to ICAM-1, vascular endothelial cell expression of VCAM-1 was only demonstrated at mRNA level following ICAM-1 expression in keratinocytes. Patterns of cytokine expression in  keratinocytes were variable. TNF alpha was strongly expressed in keratinocytes both at protein and mRNA level, while IL1 beta and IL1 alpha were only demonstrated at mRNA level. These results clearly demonstrated that bacterial superantigen could induce cell adhesion molecule expression in keratinocytes through the induction of various cytokines and play an important role in the induction of refractory eczematous lesions in atopic dermatitis.  	8869030

Wakita H(1), Tokura Y, Furukawa F, Takigawa M.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Japan.  The effects of the macrolide antibiotic, roxithromycin (RXM) on immunological functions of cultured normal human keratinocytes (NHK) were studied. RXM neither  modulated the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and human  histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR nor mobilized intracellular free calcium in NHK that were cultured in medium alone. However, the ICAM-1 and HLA-DR expression induced by cultivation with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was upregulated and suppressed, respectively, by pretreatment of NHK with RXM. Whereas ICAM-1 upregulation was observed with RXM at a concentration as high as 0.1 mM, the inhibition of HLA-DR expression by RXM was virtually dose-dependent at doses ranging from 100 nM to 0.1 mM. Accessory cell function of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-bearing NHK in terms of the T-cell response to staphylococcal enterotoxin B was suppressed by pretreatment of NHK with RXM, indicating the functional consequence of RXM-induced reduction of MHC class II molecules. Furthermore, RXM inhibited IFN-gamma-mediated upregulation of IL-1 alpha secretion by NHK. These results show that RXM suppresses immunological functions of keratinocytes triggered by IFN-gamma and suggest the therapeutic relevance of RXM to T cell-mediated inflammatory skin diseases and T cell malignancies such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and cutaneous T cell lymphoma,  which can be exacerbated by keratinocytes immunologically modulated by exposure to IFN-gamma.  	8850311

Boehncke WH(1), Wortmann S, Kaufmann R, Mielke V, Sterry W.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Ulm, Germany.  In this paper, we describe the immunophenotype and ultrastructure of a new macrophage subpopulation present in inflamed but not in normal human skin. In biopsy material from patients with psoriasis (n = 4), atopic dermatitis (n = 4),  and positive patch test reactions (n = 4), spindle-shaped macrophages located along the basement membrane were detected staining positive for CD11c (LeuM5 high, Ki-M1 low), CD68 (Ki-M6 low), and Ki-M8 (low). This subpopulation was most  prominent in psoriasis, where a median of 34 macrophages neighbored 100 basal keratinocytes, thus covering about 80% of the dermoepidermal junction. The numbers of atopic and positive patch test reactions were 11 and 13, respectively, accounting for about 20% of the dermoepidermal junction. Transmission electron microscopy revealed an electron-lucent nucleus with dense deposits of chromatin along the nuclear membrane. Interruptions of the integrity of the basement membrane neighboring these cells were also seen. We repeatedly observed parts of  basal keratinocytes merging through these openings and macrophages exhibiting cytoplasmic extentions directed toward the porus. Our observations suggest vigorous interactions between macrophages and basal keratinocytes and support the hypothesis that these interactions are an important regulatory event in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.  	8600778

Weller FR(1), De Jong MC, Weller MS, Heeres K, De Monchy JG, Jansen HM.  Author information:  (1)Department of Pulmonology, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.  In view of increasing evidence suggesting an active immunoregulatory role of the  skin keratinocytes and the observation that the differentiation of allergen specific T lymphocytes is critical in the development of allergy, we evaluated epidermal expression of HLA-DR antigen in skin reactions induced with an atopen (house dust mite) and with an non-atopic antigen (Hemocyanin). Two groups of patients with house dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus [Der p]) allergy were compared, one group was skin tested with Der p, the other group was immunized and subsequently skin tested with Helix pomatia Hemocyanin (HPH). Biopsy specimens taken at 48 h after the HPH (n = 11) and Der p (n = 11) tests were analysed immunohistologically. Reactions in both groups were comparable in size. Immunohistological analysis showed domination by CD4+ lymphocytes. Expression of HLA-DR antigen by epidermal keratinocytes was observed in six out of 11 of the HPH induced reactions, but in none of the Der p induced reactions. Eosinophils were spotted only throughout the Der p induced reactions, showing a good correlation with the number of CD4 positive lymphocytes. The lack of HLA-DR  expression by keratinocytes during the allergen-induced reaction, compared with the Hemocyanin induced reaction can be the result of a difference in cytokine profile of the lymphocytes dominating the dermal infiltrate. On the other hand evidence exists that defective HLA-DR expression by keratinocytes enhances antigen induced lymphocyte activation, and may thus contribute to the development of allergen-specific T-lymphocytes.  	7788573

Garmann EM(1), Gollnick HP.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University Medical Center Steglitz, Free University of Berlin, Germany.  Little is known about the composition of the cellular infiltrate in the early elicitation phase of contact allergy in atopic individuals. Therefore, we rechallenged ten presensitized disease-free atopic volunteers with their known contact allergen and performed biopsies at time 0 and after 6 and 24 h. Ten patients with acute exacerbated atopic dermatitis in the early stage were chosen  as a control group. Skin biopsy specimens were processed for immunohistochemistry (APAAP) and evaluated by computer-assisted morphometry. CD4+ and CD45R0+ cells were found to be significantly increased after 6 (t6) and 24 h (t24), and this was accompanied by an enhanced TCR alpha/beta receptor expression at t6-CD45O+ cells showed a marked influx into the epidermis at t24. CD8+ cells infiltrated the basal layer of the epidermis, thus changing the CD4/CD8 ratio from 4.6:1 at t0 to 2.2:1 at t6. CD1a+ epidermal dendritic cells increased significantly from 811 +/- 240/mm2 at t0, to 1210 +/- 333/mm2 at t24 (P < 0.01). At t6 and t24, a so-called 'epitope CD1a+ shedding' was observed into the intercellular spaces of  keratinocytes as well as an elongation and enlargement of the dendrites of CD1a+  cells. In the upper dermis, the number of CD1a+ cells increased from 1098 +/- 485/mm2 at t0 to 2388 +/- 740/mm2 at t24 (P < 0.01). In 7/10 volunteers, IgE+ dendritic cells increased significantly in number at t6 (P < 0.02). The activation markers HLA-DR and CD25 were expressed most distinctly at t24. Interestingly, expression of ICAM-1 on keratinocytes occurred only in four of the ten atopic volunteers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  	7763083
339. Dermatology. 1995;190(1):14-8.	 Elevated serum levels of soluble adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and ELAM-1 in patients with severe atopic eczema and influence of UVA1 treatment.  Kowalzick L(1), Kleinheinz A, Neuber K, Weichenthal M, Köhler I, Ring J.  Author information:  (1)Universitäts-Hautklinik, Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany.  BACKGROUND: ICAM-1 is known to be strongly expressed on keratinocytes in lesional atopic eczema correlating with the degree of inflammation. ELAM-1 was found to be expressed on dermal vascular endothelium in lesional atopic eczematous skin. OBJECTIVE: The present study was performed to investigate whether elevated serum  levels of soluble forms of these molecules are detectable in patients with severe atopic eczema and whether these parameters could be useful markers for disease activity. METHODS: Serum levels of soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1) and ELAM-1 (sELAM-1) were measured by ELISA in 18 patients with severe atopic eczema before and after UVA1  therapy. RESULTS: Before onset of treatment, serum sICAM-1 (565 +/- 99 ng/ml) and sELAM-1  (89.7 +/- 29.9 ng/ml) levels were significantly (p < 0.001) elevated compared to  22 healthy control persons (296 +/- 46 and 48.8 +/- 22.7 ng/ml). After achievement of significant clinical improvement after 3 weeks of UVA1 therapy, there was neither a decrease in serum sICAM-1 nor in sELAM-1 levels. The posttherapeutic serum sICAM-1 and sELAM-1 values remained elevated (p < 0.001) above the normal range. CONCLUSION: Based on these data we suggest that (1) serum sICAM-1 and sELAM-1 are elevated in patients with severe atopic eczema, (2) sICAM-1 does not decrease together with reduction of ICAM-1-positive keratinocytes in atopic eczema following clinical improvement and might therefore be mainly of a different origin, i.e. leukocytes/endothelial cells, and that (3) sICAM-1 and sELAM-1 seem  not to be suitable markers of actual disease activity in severe atopic eczema.  	7534511

Author information:  (1)INSERM Unité 346, Clinique Dermatologique, Hôpital Edouard-Herriot, Lyon, France.  The skin is not only a physico-mechanical barrier between the environment and the body, but it also functions as an immune organ. The immunological function of epidermis is principally linked to the presence in this tissue of a distinct subpopulation of dendritic cells: the Langerhans cells (LC). LC constitute 2-4% of epidermal cell population and within epidermis they are the only cells which express MHC class II antigens constitutively. LC play a key role in the initiation of T cell responses to cutaneous antigens by picking up the antigen and migrating to the draining lymph node where they trigger specific T cell activation. There is also evidence that keratinocytes participate in immune responses in the skin since these cells produce a wide variety of cytokines that  can modulate T cell responses. Dendritic cells comprise a system of highly efficient antigen-presenting cells which initiate immune responses such as the sensitization of T cells restricted by major histocompatibility complex molecules, the rejection of organ transplants and the formation of T-cell-dependent antibodies. Dendritic cells are found in many non-lymphoid tissues, such as skin and mucosa (Langerhans cells), and they migrate after antigen capture through the afferent lymph or the bloodstream to lymphoid organs, where they efficiently present antigen to T cells. Dendritic cells are difficult  to isolate and, although they originate from bone marrow their growth and differentiation are still poorly characterized. Granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) favours the out-growth of dendritic cells from mouse  peripheral blood. The cooperation between GM-CSF and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is crucial for the generation of human dendritic/Langerhans cells from CD34+ haematopoietic progenitors. The availability of large numbers of these cells should now facilitate the understanding of their role in immunological regulation and disorder. Recent studies reported that after 2-3 days in vitro incubation, both murine and human LC undergo profound phenotypic changes, as an enhancement in the expression of MHC class I and II antigens, LFA-3 and ICAM-1 molecules, a concomitant decrease of CD1a antigens and a loss of Fc gamma RII. Furthermore, cultured LC (cLC) lose or markedly reduce their specific cytoplasmic organelles: the Birbeck granules. Therefore, after a 2-3 days in vitro incubation, LC seem to acquire most of the features of lymphoid dendritic cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)  	7834504

Distribution of apoptosis-mediating Fas antigen in human skin and effects of anti-Fas monoclonal antibody on human epidermal keratinocyte and squamous cell carcinoma cell lines.  Oishi M(1), Maeda K, Sugiyama S.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, Sapporo Medical University, Japan.  Fast antigen is a cell surface protein that mediates apoptosis. Using immunohistological, flow cytometry and electron microscopic analyses, we investigated the expression of Fas antigen on various skin tissues, and on cultured SV40-transformed human epidermal keratinocyte cell line KJD and human skin squamous cell carcinoma cell line HSC. The Fas antigen was widely distributed in skin components such as the keratinocytes in the lower portion of  the epidermis, epidermal dendritic cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, apocrine glands, eccrine sweat glands, sebaceous glands, some normal melanocytes  and infiltrating lymphoid cells. It was also strongly expressed on the keratinocytes of lichenoid eruptions seen in lupus erythematosus and lichen planus, and on the spongiotic or acanthotic epidermis seen in chronic eczema, adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and atopic dermatitis. Its expression was  closely correlated with lymphoid infiltrating cells and it was strongly expressed in lymphoid neoplastic cells, particularly ATLL cells, and fibroblasts seen in dermatofibroma. However, the antigen was not detected on basal cell epithelioma cells, some malignant melanomas or any junctional naevi. The cell lines KJD and HSC strongly expressed the Fas antigen, and crosslinking of the Fas antigen by an anti-Fas monoclonal antibody induced apoptosis of these cell lines. These results indicate that the apoptosis-mediating Fas antigen may play an important role in normal skin turnover and cell differentiation, in immune regulation of skin tumours, and in the pathogenesis of various skin diseases.  	7529480

Perelman Department of Dermatology, New York University School of Medicine, New York 10016.  Among the most interesting medical developments of the twentieth century is the revelation that the skin is an organ of major immunologic importance (about 95 percent of resident cells in the epidermis [keratinocytes and Langerhans cells] can serve immunologic functions). Allergic contact-type dermatitis and its underlying mechanism, allergic contact-type sensitization, have been a highly useful model in uncovering the facts that are the basis for this statement. The comments in this article deal with a few randomly selected findings that have been reported in the literature during the past twenty years. They include the probable role of the Birbeck granules in the process of antigen presentation by Langerhans cells; photomodulation of important immunologic reactions by ultraviolet radiation; a previously unrecognized form of contact allergy, apparently present only at clinically active sites of atopic dermatitis (and engendered by small protein antigens rather than by small molecular ["simple chemical"] compounds); and the first factual evidence that epidermal Langerhans cells may be subject to control by intraepidermally located parts of the peripheral nervous system.  	8299387

Lidén S(1), Scheynius A, Fischer T, Johansson SG, Ruhnek-Forsbeck M, Stejskal V.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.  Immunologic reactions are customarily divided into two broad categories, cell-mediated and antibody-mediated. An interplay between these two pathogenetic  principles is indicated by reactions such as cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity, late-phase reaction, and cutaneous lesions indistinguishable from regular allergic contact dermatitis lesions after sensitization with IgE antibodies against certain haptens. In the present study, 23 patients with a history of a positive epicutaneous test to formaldehyde participated. On retest, 15 showed a positive reaction. Eight patients were Phadiatop positive, indicating an atopic diathesis, and eight had a history of or ongoing atopic dermatitis. On RAST test, only two, nonatopic patients had specific IgE antibodies to formaldehyde. In the  cellular infiltrates of biopsies from epicutaneous test sites, cells reactive with monoclonal antibodies against IgE were found in positive and negative formalin tests, both in atopics and nonatopics, as well as in control biopsies from nonlesional skin. Double immunofluorescence staining experiments showed that IgE occurred on Langerhans' cells. The proportion of IgE-positive cells correlated to the level of serum IgE, but not to atopy. These cells were also found both in the epidermis and in the dermis in nonatopic patients. ICAM-1 occurred on keratinocytes in all patient groups. This study does not support the  hypothesis that specific IgE antibodies are active in the pathogenesis of contact sensitivity to formaldehyde either in atopic or in nonatopic patients.  	7902023

Groves RW(1), Ross EL, Barker JN, MacDonald DM.  Author information:  (1)Laboratory of Applied Dermatopathology, St Johns Institute of Dermatology, United Medical School, Guy's Hospital, London, United Kingdom.  BACKGROUND: Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) is an endothelial protein  with adhesive properties for inflammatory cells including lymphocytes. Its role in skin disease and regulation in vivo are uncertain. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine expression of VCAM-1 in normal and inflamed skin and the effect on this of the T-cell-derived cytokine interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). METHODS: VCAM-1 was detected immunohistochemically in frozen-section biopsy specimens of inflammatory dermatoses and skin tumors. Volunteers received intradermal IFN-gamma and underwent biopsy 2 hours to 6 days later. RESULTS: In normal skin, VCAM-1 was present on perivascular dendritic cells and some follicular keratinocytes. In allergic contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis, VCAM-1 was variably upregulated on dermal endothelium and dendritic cells, but was most pronounced in lichen planus. IFN-gamma led to marked upregulation of endothelial and dermal dendritic cell VCAM-1. CONCLUSION: VCAM-1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of various skin diseases and in vivo, IFN-gamma is a potent modulator of its expression.  	7686190

Author information:  (1)Dermatology Service, Veterans Administration Medical Center, San Francisco, CA.  The stratum corneum, the permeability barrier between the internal milieu and the environment, is composed of fibrous protein-enriched corneocytes and a lipid-enriched intercellular matrix. The lipids are a mixture of sphingolipids, cholesterol and free fatty acids, which form intercellular membrane bilayers. Lipid synthesis occurs in the keratinocytes in all nucleated layers of the epidermis, and the newly synthesized lipids are delivered by lamellar bodies to the interstices of the stratum corneum during epidermal differentiation. Disruption of barrier function by topical acetone treatment results in an increase in the synthesis of free fatty acids, sphingolipids and cholesterol in the living layers of the epidermis, leading to barrier repair. Cholesterol and sphingolipid synthesis are regulated by the rate-limiting enzymes HMG CoA reductase and serine palmitoyl transferase (SPT), respectively. Acute barrier disruption leads to an increase in both enzymes, but with a different time curve: increase in HMG CoA reductase activity begins at 1.5 h, whereas the increase in SPT activity occurs 6 h after barrier impairment. Topical application of HMG CoA  reductase or SPT inhibitors after acetone treatment delays barrier repair, providing further evidence for a role of cholesterol and sphingolipids in epidermal barrier function. Repeated application of lovastatin to untreated skin  results in disturbed barrier function accompanied by increased DNA synthesis and  epidermal hyperplasia. Therefore, we have examined the specific relationship between barrier function and epidermal DNA synthesis. After acute and chronic disturbances not only lipid, but also DNA synthesis, is stimulated. Thus, stimulation of DNA synthesis leading to epidermal hyperplasia may be a second mechanism by which the epidermis repairs defects in barrier function. The link between barrier function and both lipid and DNA synthesis is supported further by occlusion studies. Artificial barrier repair by latex occlusion prevents an increase in both lipid and DNA synthesis. In addition, increased epidermal lipid  and DNA synthesis in essential fatty-acid deficiency can be reversed by topical applications of the n-6 unsaturated fatty acids, linoleic or columbinic acid. These studies may be of relevance in understanding the pathogenesis of hyperproliferative skin diseases, such as ichthyosis, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and irritant contact dermatitis.  	8504036

Dependence on lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1/intercellular adhesion molecule-1 interaction.  Nickoloff BJ(1), Mitra RS, Green J, Zheng XG, Shimizu Y, Thompson C, Turka LA.  Author information:  (1)Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109-0755.  A growing body of evidence points to a role for epidermal keratinocytes as active participants in immunologic reactions. Inasmuch as certain T cell-mediated skin diseases, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, are triggered by microbial infection, we asked whether multipassaged human keratinocytes could provide the costimulatory signals necessary to induce autologous T cell proliferation in response to bacterial-derived super-antigens. On exposure to IFN-gamma, keratinocytes are induced to express HLA-DR and HLA-DQ class II MHC Ag, and the lymphocyte function-associated Ag-1 counter-receptor intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). This change in keratinocyte phenotype is accompanied by the  ability of these cells to support T cell proliferation induced by two different bacterial-derived superantigens, staphylococcal enterotoxins A and B. Superantigen-driven proliferation in the presence of IFN-gamma-treated keratinocytes was significantly inhibited (70-90% reduction) by mAb against the LFA-1 alpha- or beta-chain or ICAM-1. Proliferation was not inhibited by mAb against the CD28 ligands BB-1 or B7, even though these keratinocytes express BB-1. In addition to previous defined roles for class II MHC Ag, stimulation of LFA-1 on the T cells by ICAM-1 on the keratinocytes also plays an important costimulatory role in this superantigen-mediated response. The accessory cell capability of keratinocytes was not unique to superantigen driven responses as PHA, as well as anti-CD3 mAb also induced vigorous T cell proliferation when IFN-gamma-treated keratinocytes were added. However, IFN-gamma-treated keratinocytes consistently failed to provoke an allogeneic response. These data demonstrate that 1) keratinocytes can serve as accessory cells for T cell proliferation using a variety of different stimuli, 2) the LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction plays a major role in keratinocyte-mediated costimulation, and 3) previous reports in which IFN-gamma-treated keratinocytes failed to support T cell proliferation to nominal or alloantigens, may reflect impaired Ag presentation via class II MHC molecules, rather than lack of necessary costimulatory signals. These findings highlighting the accessory cell function of keratinocytes may have implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis of  immunologic disorders of the skin.  	8450207

Modulation in the expression of immunologic markers in lesional skin.  van Joost T(1), Kozel MM, Tank B, Troost R, Prens EP.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermato-Venereology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.  BACKGROUND: In previous studies, oral cyclosporine was highly effective in the treatment of patients with severe atopic dermatitis. In this study seven patients with severe and therapy-resistant atopic dermatitis underwent therapy with cyclosporine, 5 mg/kg/day, for 6 weeks. OBJECTIVE: The effect of cyclosporine on the expression of cytokines, which probably play a role in this disease, was examined. METHODS: The study was performed with a panel of antibodies as markers of inflammatory cells, adhesion molecules, and cytokines (interferon-gamma [IFN-gamma], tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha] and interleukins 1 alpha, 1  beta, and 8 [IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-8, respectively]). They were visualized by indirect immunoperoxidase techniques. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of cyclosporine therapy, a reduction of 60% in the disease (severity and extent) was observed. This reduction was 89% after 4 weeks and 90%  after 6 weeks of therapy. Results of indirect immunoperoxidase stains performed on lesional skin sections after 2 weeks of treatment showed statistically significant reduced numbers of CD14+, CD25 (IL-2R+) and IL-8+ inflammatory cells  in the dermis and CD36(OKM5)+ cells in both the epidermis and dermis. The number  of cells expressing IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, assumed to be the products of the helper T-cell (TH)1 subset, was unaltered despite the impressive clinical benefit observed. Keratinocytes in lesional atopic skin did not express intercellular adhesion molecule type 1 (ICAM-1). The expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1, lymphocyte function-associated (LFA) type 1, and LFA-3 on inflammatory cells also remained unaffected by cyclosporine treatment. CONCLUSION: A statistically significant reduction in the number of activated T cells and in the number of cells expressing the IL-2 receptor (CD25) paralleled a marked improvement in the disease and supports the view that atopic dermatitis is based on a T-cell-mediated immune inflammation.  	1479097

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Munich, Germany.  12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) is assumed to play a central role in the pathophysiology of psoriasis. Since its effects in skin are mediated by specific high-affinity receptors, we studied the receptor characteristics in cultured epidermal cells from involved and apparently healthy skin of psoriasis patients by radioligand binding assay. Involved and uninvolved psoriatic epidermal cells showed a fourfold decrease in the number of 12-HETE binding sites as compared with normal healthy individuals and patients with atopic dermatitis,  while receptor affinity remained unchanged. The decrease in receptor number was evident in psoriatic cells even in long-term culture and was not due to receptor  down-regulation, defective response to interferon gamma or to protease degradation of receptor protein. The decrease in the number of 12-HETE receptors  detectable even in clinically normal psoriatic skin functionally leads to diminished 12-HETE uptake and may thus represent a primary central molecular defect in the pathophysiology of the disease.  	1323467
349. J Invest Dermatol. 1992 Feb;98(2):166-70.	 Common pathogenetic pathways in allergic and irritant contact dermatitis.  Brasch J(1), Burgard J, Sterry W.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Kiel, FRG.  Despite their different pathogeneses, allergic and irritant contact dermatitis show a remarkable similarity with respect to clinical appearance, histology, and  immunohistology. To further analyze this apparent contradiction, our study was designed to meticulously compare cellular infiltrates in irritant and allergic patch-test reactions by immunostaining with a broad panel of monoclonal antibodies. For this purpose, skin biopsies from allergic and irritant patch-test reactions of similar inflammatory degree were obtained from the same probands. We found that after 72 h both types of reaction were characterized by an identical dermal infiltrate consisting mainly of memory T cells, many of which were activated, and macrophages. Dermal and epidermal Langerhans cell density and HLA--DR expression of keratinocytes were also virtually identical. Our results show that antigen recognition by specific memory T cells as well as irritants can finally induce the same pattern of inflammation, including activation of T cells  obviously independent of exogenous antigen.  	1370676

Hyperstimulatory CD1a+CD1b+CD36+ Langerhans cells are responsible for increased autologous T lymphocyte reactivity to lesional epidermal cells of patients with atopic dermatitis.  Taylor RS(1), Baadsgaard O, Hammerberg C, Cooper KD.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor.  We studied whether abnormalities in epidermal APC could be responsible for intracutaneous T cell activation in atopic dermatitis (AD). In the absence of added Ag, patients' peripheral blood T cells demonstrated significantly increased proliferation to their autologous lesional epidermal cells (mean +/- SEM = 19,726 +/- 9,754 cpm [3H]TdR uptake) relative to epidermal cells from uninvolved AD skin (2179 +/- 697 cpm) (n = 10) (p = 0.0001, log transformed data). AD T cell proliferative responses to autologous epidermal cells were dependent upon cells expressing HLA-DR, CD1a, and CD36, and not upon keratinocytes or their cytokines. Ultrastructurally, these cells ranged from typical Langerhans cells to indeterminate cells with irregular nuclear contours. Enriched populations of lesional AD Langerhans cells were highly stimulatory for autologous T cells, whereas equal numbers of Langerhans cells from non atopic epidermis were poor stimulators, even at high concentrations. The dermal perivascular dendritic cell  markers CD36 and CD1b, not usually present on normal epidermal APC, were expressed by 40 and 60% of lesional AD CD1a+ epidermal Langerhans cells, respectively. Addition of anti-CD1b to cocultures of AD epidermal cells and autologous T lymphocytes augmented T cell activation, suggesting that the expression of CD1b by AD Langerhans cells may represent over expression of a molecule functionally linked to the enhanced T cell stimulatory capacity of these cells. Thus, stimulatory signals for T cells contained within AD epidermis are carried by cells in an abnormal differentiation state as indicated by expression  of phenotypic characteristics of both epidermal and dermal antigen presenting cells (HLA-DR+, CD1a+, CD1b+, CD36+). We propose that activation of autologous T  cells by an altered cutaneous APC population may represent a mechanism for the hyperactive and disordered cell-mediated immune response that characterizes the dermatitic lesions of AD.  	1719088

Author information:  (1)Laboratory of Applied Dermatopathology, UMDS Guy's Campus, Guy's Hospital, London, U.K.  Endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1) is a recently described endothelial surface glycoprotein which is inducible by interleukin 1 (IL-1), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Using an immunohistochemical technique and a monoclonal antibody (1.2B6) specific for ELAM-1 we have found marked vascular endothelial expression of ELAM-1 in many cutaneous inflammatory disorders, including allergic contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, and in dermal infiltrates associated with benign, premalignant and malignant keratinocyte proliferation. In normal skin, minimal levels of ELAM-1 expression were detected. In psoriasis, double-immunoenzyme staining studies revealed a close spatial relationship between ELAM-1 expression  and neutrophil margination, suggesting a functional link. Recombinant human interferon-gamma (30 micrograms) injected intradermally in normal adult human volunteers did not substantially upregulate ELAM-1 in contrast to its marked effect on intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression, indicating that  this cytokine is probably not involved in ELAM-1 induction in vivo. These results indicate that ELAM-1 is widely induced in cutaneous inflammation with a time course of expression that is longer than that observed in vitro. As ELAM-1 acts as an adhesion ligand for neutrophils, and perhaps monocytes, the expression of this molecule in cutaneous lesions is likely to be an indication of the ability of vascular endothelium to recruit these cells from the circulation. Furthermore, the cytokine inducibility of ELAM-1 is indirect evidence for functional interactions between perivascular mononuclear cells, other resident cells and the blood vessel wall.  	1706195

This was not observed in the epidermis in healthy subjects. The authors suggest that fibronectin on the surface of Langerhans cells and keratinocytes may play a role in antigen presentation.  	2267350

Author information:  (1)Laboratory of Applied Dermatopathology, United Medical School, London, U.K.  Keratinocyte expression of the monocyte/macrophage surface antigens defined by OKM1 and OKM5 antibodies (Ortho Diagnostics) was examined using the peroxidase anti-peroxidase immunohistochemical technique. A range of inflammatory cutaneous  disorders were investigated, including lichen planus, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Positive suprabasal keratinocyte expression of OKM5 antigen was observed in all disorders, while keratinocyte staining with OKMI antibody was consistently negative. These results provide further evidence that keratinocytes  may play an important role in cutaneous immune responses. Furthermore, they are consistent with the recent observation that HLA-DR positive keratinocytes may modulate cutaneous immunological reactions by inducing T-cell unresponsiveness.  	2474314

Characterization of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and HLA-DR expression in normal and inflamed skin: modulation by recombinant gamma interferon and tumor necrosis factor.  Griffiths CE(1), Voorhees JJ, Nickoloff BJ.  Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor.  Lymphocytes bind to cultured keratinocytes that are treated with interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). When the lymphocytes are preincubated with antibody to lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), this adherence is inhibited. Because intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is a ligand for LFA-1, we studied the cellular expression of ICAM-1, as well as two other IFN-gamma-inducible antigens, (HLA) human lymphocyte antigens DR and DQ, in both normal and diseased skin. The modulation of these cell surface antigens by IFN-gamma and TNF with the use of short-term organ cultures of skin was compared with isolated keratinocytes grown in a conventional tissue culture system. While in normal skin, keratinocytes did not express HLA-DR, DQ, or ICAM-1, when organ cultures were supplemented with IFN-gamma, rapid induction of  keratinocyte ICAM-1 expression occurred after 24 hours; HLA-DR but not DQ expression occurred after 48 hours. TNF also induced keratinocyte ICAM-1 expression (although to a lesser degree than IFN-gamma) but did not induce either keratinocyte HLA-DR or DQ expression. There was good correlation of keratinocyte  expression of ICAM-1 and HLA-DR by IFN-gamma and TNF when the epidermis of the organ culture system was compared with the isolated keratinocytes grown in tissue culture. The presence of intraepidermal lymphocytes correlated extremely well with keratinocyte ICAM-1 expression but not with keratinocyte HLA-DR expression in psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, lichen planus, and mycosis fungoides. The intensity of endothelial cell expression of ICAM-1 correlated with the degree of  dermal inflammation. We conclude that IFN-gamma, once produced by activated T lymphocytes in the dermis, may be of importance in lymphocyte trafficking in the  epidermis by the induction of keratinocyte ICAM-1 expression. The use of the short-term organ culture system, in which there is inducible ICAM-1 expression, provides an experimental bridge between purely in vitro and in vivo investigations to further our understanding of the molecular basis for lymphocyte apposition to keratinocytes in the skin.  	2497153

Apparently normal, and lesional skin from patients with atopic eczema were investigated immunohistochemically with anti-HLA-DR, -CD1a and -IgE antisera. A CD1a+ intercellular pattern was observed in uninvolved skin in the majority of the patients whereas an HLA-DR+/CD1a+ network, mostly localized in basal and supra-basal areas, was shown in lesional skin of virtually all of them. Moreover, an HLA-DR+/CD1a+IgE+ intercellular pattern was observed in some of the patients only and was predominantly localized in those areas characterized by lymphocyte exocytosis, spongiosis or vesicle formation. Whether keratinocytes are able to synthesize CD1a antigen and Fc epsilon R or if these molecules are only produced  and shed by CD1a+/IgE+ epidermal dendritic cells remains unclear.  	2478318

Author information:  (1)Department of Dermatology, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland.  To study whether inhalant allergens could induce eczematous reactions on normal skin of atopic patients we applied birch pollen and house dust mite antigens at 500 times the concentration used for prick testing as epicutaneous tests. Six out of 17 patients with atopic dermatitis in remission had positive delayed type reactions to birch pollen and three to house dust mite. Only one out of 13 atopic patients without history of atopic dermatitis but with seasonal allergic rhinitis had a positive patch test reaction to birch pollen and no patient had positive test reactions to house dust mite. No positive patch test reactions to birch pollen or house dust mite were seen in the ten healthy control subjects. In patients with positive test reactions biopsies from the test sites revealed epidermal spongiosis and vesiculation. Immunostaining of the epidermis revealed keratinocytes displaying both CD1 and HLA-DR. The present study suggests that inhalant allergens can exacerbate atopic dermatitis.  	2477976

Absolute numbers of circulating lymphocytes were normal in all patients. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis revealed normal numbers of total T lymphocytes and T-helper and T-suppressor subsets (helper:suppressor ratio, 2:1) in the atopic patients' peripheral blood, but an increase in circulating B lymphocytes and in HLA-D-related antigen-bearing cells. The skin biopsy showed a dermal infiltrate of predominantly T-helper lymphocytes (helper:suppressor ratio, 7:1). These cells showed strong HLA-DR plasma membrane staining. There was no HLA-DR staining in the membranes of epidermal keratinocytes. Using a monoclonal antihuman IgE, positive staining was observed in the dermis, though none was identified in the epidermis. The dermal anti-IgE staining was concentrated around clusters of T lymphocytes.  	3298446

Epidermal patterns of class II human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) expression in atopic and allergic contact dermatitis have been compared, using monoclonal antibodies recognizing each subregion. Expression of class II human lymphocyte antigens on keratinocytes has been confirmed in allergic contact dermatitis, while we have found them to be absent in atopic dermatitis. This finding argues that cell-mediated immune responses, possibly to epicutaneous contact with allergen, are not implicated in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis.  	2439553
